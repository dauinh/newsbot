        "body": "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., July 26, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nDomestic Private Client Group net new assets(1)(2) of $14.4 billion for the fiscal third quarter, 5.4% annualized growth rate from beginning of period assetsRecord quarterly net revenues of $2.91 billion, up 7% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter and 1% over the preceding quarterQuarterly net income available to common shareholders of $369 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, and quarterly adjusted net income available to common shareholders of $399 million(3), or $1.85 per diluted share(3)Record client assets under administration of $1.28 trillion and financial assets under management of $200.7 billionNet interest income and Raymond James Bank Deposit Program (\"RJBDP\") fees from third-party banks of $708 million during the quarter, up 91% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter and down 3% compared to the preceding quarterRecord net revenues of $8.57 billion and record net income available to common shareholders of $1.30 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2023, up 5% and 22%, respectively, over the first nine months of fiscal 2022Annualized return on common equity of 17.9% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 22.7%(3) for the first nine months of fiscal 2023\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla - Raymond James Financial, Inc. (NYSE: RJF) today reported record net revenues of $2.91 billion and net income available to common shareholders of $369 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2023. Excluding $40 million of expenses related to acquisitions, quarterly adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $399 million(3), or $1.85 per diluted share(3).\n\nRecord quarterly net revenues increased 7% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter. The benefit of higher short-term interest rates on net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks more than offset declines in investment banking revenues, brokerage revenues, and asset management and related administrative fees. The 1% sequential increase in quarterly net revenues was primarily due to higher asset management and related administrative fees.\n\nQuarterly net income available to common shareholders increased 23% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter, driven primarily by higher net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks which were partially offset by elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters. Sequentially, net income available to common shareholders decreased 13%. Quarterly results were negatively impacted by elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters of approximately $65 million and bank loan provision for credit losses of $54 million.\n\nFor the first nine months of the fiscal year, record net revenues of $8.57 billion increased 5%, record earnings per diluted common share of $5.95 increased 19%, and adjusted earnings per diluted common share of $6.17(3) increased 14% over the first nine months of fiscal 2022. The Private Client Group segment generated record net revenues and record pre-tax income during the first nine months of the fiscal year. Annualized return on common equity was 17.9% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity was 22.7%(3).\n\n\"Through the strength of our businesses and perseverance of our advisors and associates, we generated record net revenues and record net income to common shareholders during the first nine months of the fiscal year, up 5% and 22%, respectively, over fiscal 2022 despite challenging macroeconomic conditions,\" said Chair and CEO Paul Reilly. \"Importantly, our strong capital ratios and flexible balance sheet keep us well-positioned as we look forward.\"\n\nSegment Results\n\nPrivate Client Group\n\nDomestic Private Client Group net new assets(1)(2) of $14.4 billion for the fiscal third quarter, 5.4% annualized growth rate from beginning of period assets Record quarterly net revenues of $2.18 billion, up 11% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter and 2% over the preceding quarterQuarterly pre-tax income of $411 million, up 64% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter and down 7% compared to the preceding quarterRecord Private Client Group assets under administration of $1.23 trillion, up 15% compared to June 2022 and 5% over March 2023Record Private Client Group assets in fee-based accounts of $697.0 billion, up 15% compared to June 2022 and 5% over March 2023Total clients' domestic cash sweep and Enhanced Savings Program (\"ESP\") balances of $58.0 billion, down 24% compared to June 2022 and up 11% over March 2023\n\nThe year-over-year growth in quarterly net revenues and pre-tax income was driven primarily by increases in RJBDP fees and net interest income, which more than offset market-driven declines in asset management and related administrative fees and brokerage revenues. Sequentially, quarterly net revenues grew 2% driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees, which were offset by a decline in RJBDP fees due to lower cash sweep balances, and lower brokerage revenues. However, quarterly pre-tax income declined 7% compared to the preceding quarter driven by higher provisions for legal and regulatory matters and seasonally higher advisor recognition events and conference expenses.\n\nTotal clients' domestic cash sweep and ESP balances grew 11% over March 2023. The increase reflects strong growth in ESP balances which more than offset a modest decline in cash sweep balances largely due to quarterly fee billings and income tax payments. Reflecting higher short-term interest rates, the average yield on RJBDP third-party bank balances increased 12 basis points to 3.37% in the fiscal third quarter.\n\n\"Financial advisor retention and recruiting are strong across our multiple affiliation options driven by our advisor and client-focused culture and leading technology and product solutions,\" said Reilly. \"For example, our recently-launched Enhanced Savings Program ended the quarter at $11.2 billion, as advisors and their clients continue to value this attractive offering.\"\n\nCapital Markets\n\nQuarterly net revenues of $276 million, down 28% compared to the prior year's fiscal third quarter and 9% compared to the preceding quarterQuarterly pre-tax loss of $34 millionQuarterly investment banking revenues of $141 million, down 35% compared to the prior year's fiscal third quarter and 3% compared to the preceding quarter\n\nThe year-over-year decline in quarterly net revenues and pre-tax income was largely attributable to lower investment banking and fixed income brokerage revenues. Compensation expense declined 9% driven by lower variable compensation, partially offset by amortization of deferred compensation and additional compensation related to growth investments.\n\n\"Investment banking activity across the industry remains muted,\" said Reilly. \"While the investment banking pipeline remains healthy and new business activity is solid, the timing of closings is largely dependent on improving market conditions.\"\n\nAsset Management\n\nQuarterly net revenues of $226 million, down 1% compared to the prior year's fiscal third quarter and up 5% over the preceding quarterQuarterly pre-tax income of $89 million, down 4% compared to the prior year's fiscal third quarter and up 9% over the preceding quarterFinancial assets under management of $200.7 billion, up 10% over June 2022 and 3% over March 2023\n\nFinancial assets under management of $200.7 billion grew 10% over the prior-year quarter and 3% over the preceding quarter. The increase in financial assets under management was primarily the result of higher equity markets, along with net inflows into fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group.\n\nBank\n\nQuarterly net revenues of $514 million, up 86% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter and down 5% compared to the preceding quarterQuarterly pre-tax income of $66 million, down 11% compared to the prior year's fiscal third quarter and 27% compared to the preceding quarterBank segment net interest margin (\"NIM\") of 3.26% for the quarter, up 85 basis points over the prior year's fiscal third quarter and down 37 basis points compared to the preceding quarterNet loans of $43.3 billion, up 4% over June 2022 and down 1% compared to March 2023\n\nQuarterly net revenues increased over the prior-year quarter driven by higher asset balances and the favorable impact from higher short-term interest rates. Sequentially, quarterly net revenues declined 5% due to lower net interest income. The Bank segment's NIM decreased 37 basis points during the quarter to 3.26%, primarily due to increased interest expense from higher-cost funding as ESP balances replaced a portion of lower-cost RJBDP client cash sweep balances. Net loans increased 4% over the prior-year quarter and declined 1% compared to the preceding quarter primarily driven by lower corporate loans. Quarterly bank loan provision for credit losses of $54 million increased over the preceding quarter primarily due to weaker macroeconomic assumptions for the Moody's CRE Price Index in the Current Expected Credit Loss (\"CECL\") model. Despite a higher provision, the credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid, with criticized loans as a percent of total loans held for investment ending the quarter at 0.94%, down from 1.63% at June 2022 and up slightly from 0.92% at March 2023. Bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans held for investment was 1.04%, and bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percent of corporate loans held for investment was 1.90%.\n\nOther\n\nDuring the fiscal third quarter, the firm repurchased 3.31 million shares of common stock for $300 million at an average price of $91 per share. As of July 26, 2023, approximately $750 million remained available under the Board's approved common stock repurchase authorization. At the end of the quarter, the total capital ratio was 22.0%(4) and the tier 1 leverage ratio was 11.4%(4), both well above regulatory requirements.\n\nA conference call to discuss the results will take place today, Wednesday, July 26, at 5:00 p.m. ET.

(\"Acadian\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:ADN) today reported financial and operating results1 for the three months ended June 24, 2023 (the \"second quarter\").\n\n\"While the second quarter of the year is traditionally our slowest due to seasonal operating conditions, favourable weather allowed harvest to continue later into the winter and to begin earlier after the spring thaw. Combined with increased contractor capacity, Acadian delivered strong second quarter results and recovered much of the volume shortfall of the first quarter,\" commented Adam Sheparski, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We are also pleased to announce the successful registration of our first voluntary carbon credits, which are now available for sale.\"\n\nAcadian generated $4.1 million of Free Cash Flow during the second quarter and declared dividends of $4.9 million to shareholders. Acadian's balance sheet remains solid with $17.0 million of net liquidity as at June 24, 2023, which includes funds available under our credit facilities.\n\nOn June 8, 2023, 770,071 voluntary carbon credits were registered on the American Carbon Registry and made available for sale under the project name Anew - Katahdin Forestry Project, and have been recorded as inventory in our June 24, 2023 interim condensed consolidated financial statements. These carbon credits are associated with our first carbon credit development project on the portion of our Maine Timberlands that is subject to a working forest conservation easement.\n\nThe total volume of credits expected to be generated from the project over the 10-year crediting period has increased from the initial estimate of 1.6 million credits to 1.9 million credits. Actual credit issuances will be adjusted each reporting period based on actual harvesting, natural disturbances, and other factors, as well as periodic updating for inventory and verification activities.\n\nAcadian is committed to health and safety as our number one priority. We believe that emphasizing and achieving a good safety performance is a leading indicator of success in the broader business. Acadian's operations experienced no recordable safety incidents during the quarter among employees or contractors.\n\n1 This news release makes reference to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Free Cash Flow and Payout Ratios which are key performance measures in evaluating Acadian's operations and are important in enhancing investors' understanding of the Company's operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are indicative of the underlying profitability of Acadian's operating segments and are used to evaluate operational performance. Free Cash Flow is used to evaluate Acadian's ability to generate sustainable cash flows from our operations while Payout Ratios are used to evaluate Acadian's ability to fund its distribution using Free Cash Flow. Acadian's management defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, fair value adjustments, recovery of or impairment of land and roads and depreciation and amortization, and \"Adjusted EBITDA margin\" as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Acadian's sales. Free Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less interest paid, current income tax expense, and capital expenditures plus net proceeds from the sale of timberlands and other fixed assets (proceeds less gains or losses). Reference made to \"Payout Ratio\" is defined as dividends declared divided by Free Cash Flow, and Payout Ratio with DRIP is defined as dividends paid in cash divided by Free Cash Flow. We have provided in this news release reconciliations of net income, as determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), to Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. Reference is also made to net liquidity which includes cash and funds available under credit facilities less amounts reserved to support the minimum cash balance related to long-term debt. As these measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS, they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis for further details.\n\nReview of Operations\n\nFinancial and Operating Highlights\n\nThree Months EndedSix Months Ended(CAD thousands, except per share information)June 24, 2023 June 25, 2022June 24, 2023June 25, 2022Sales volume (000s m3) 184.2 156.7 389.4 457.9Sales$20,707$ 16,493$43,069$ 43,124Operating income 5,217 2,684 10,521 9,522Net income 5,813 4,516 11,433 8,674Adjusted EBITDA$5,651$ 2,747$11,252$ 9,656Adjusted EBITDA margin 27% 17% 26% 22%Free Cash Flow$4,108$ 1,877$7,831$ 6,891Dividends declared 4,940 4,856 9,859 9,695Dividends paid in cash 3,724 3,713 7,445 8,552Payout Ration/an/a 126% 141%Payout Ratio with DRIPn/an/a 95% 124%Per share - basic and diluted Net income$0.34$ 0.27$0.67$ 0.52Free Cash Flow 0.24 0.11 0.46 0.41Dividends declared 0.29 0.29 0.58 0.58\n\nDuring the second quarter, Acadian generated sales of $20.7 million, compared to $16.5 million in the prior year period. The weighted average selling price, excluding biomass, increased 9% year-over-year, benefiting from strong softwood sawlog and hardwood pulpwood prices driven by strong demand.\n\nSales volume, excluding biomass, was 18% higher compared to the prior year period as a result of favourable weather, which allowed harvest to continue later into the winter and to begin earlier after the spring thaw, and increased contractor availability. Biomass sales volume was 8% higher due to favourable market conditions.\n\nOperating costs and expenses were $15.5 million during the second quarter, compared to $13.8 million during the prior year period, reflecting higher sales volumes. Weighted average variable costs, excluding biomass, were 10% lower as compared to the prior year period, primarily as a result of lower fuel costs and shorter hauling distances, partially offset by increased contractor rates.\n\nNet income for the second quarter totaled $5.8 million, or $0.34 per share, compared to $4.5 million, or $0.27 per share, in the same period of 2022. The increase in net income compared to the prior year period was primarily the result of higher operating income and gain on the sale of 16 acres of timberlands, partially offset by lower non-cash fair value adjustments.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $5.7 million during the second quarter compared to $2.7 million in the prior year period, reflecting higher operating income and gain on sale of timberlands. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 27% compared to 17% in the prior year period. Free Cash Flow was $4.1 million, being $2.2 million higher than the prior year period.\n\nDuring the first half of 2023, Acadian generated sales of $43.1 million, consistent with the prior year period. Sales volume, excluding biomass, was 18% lower than the first half of 2022 but was offset by a 13% increase in the weighted average selling price, excluding biomass. Operating costs and expenses of $32.5 million were $1.1 million lower year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $11.3 million was $1.6 million higher compared to the prior year period.\n\nFor the six months ended June 24, 2023, net income was $11.4 million, or $0.67 per share, which represents an increase of $2.7 million compared to the prior year period, primarily the result of higher operating income, gain on sale of timberlands and non-cash fair value adjustments.\n\nSegment Performance\n\nNew Brunswick Timberlands\n\nThe table below summarizes operating and financial results for New Brunswick Timberlands.\n\nThree Months EndedSix Months Ended June 24, 2023June 25, 2022June 24, 2023June 25, 2022Harvest (000s m3) Softwood 58.6 48.3 145.5 176.4Hardwood 47.2 42.5 109.4 110.7Biomass - 3.5 25.8 29.5Total 105.8 94.3 280.7 316.6Sales (000s m3) Softwood 60.2 55.7 145.3 181.3Hardwood 80.2 64.0 124.4 115.8Biomass 7.1 3.5 32.9 29.5Total 147.5 123.2 302.6 326.6Sales Mix Softwood 41% 45% 48% 56%Hardwood 54% 52% 41% 35%Biomass 5% 3% 11% 9%Total 100% 100% 100% 100%Results ($000s) Softwood $4,238$4,023$10,486$12,197Hardwood 7,899 5,641 12,760 10,146Biomass 320 152 1,630 1,308Total $12,457$9,816$24,876$23,651Timber services and other 4,112 3,728 9,600 7,902Sales $16,569$13,544$34,476$31,553Adjusted EBITDA $4,996$2,710$9,879$7,378Adjusted EBITDA margin 30% 20% 29% 23%\n\nSales for New Brunswick Timberlands in the second quarter were $16.6 million compared to $13.5 million during the prior year period. Sales volume, excluding biomass, increased by 17% primarily due to favourable weather conditions compared to the second quarter of the prior year and increased contractor availability. Biomass sales volume increased by 98% as compared to the prior year period due to favourable market conditions.\n\nThe weighted average selling price, excluding biomass, for the second quarter was $86.36 per m3, or 7% higher than the prior year period, as a result of stable softwood sawlog and pulpwood prices, driven by strong demand, partially offset by lower hardwood sawlog pricing due to unfavourable end use markets. Biomass prices were 7% higher year-over-year due to favourable market conditions.\n\nOperating costs and expenses were $11.9 million during the second quarter, compared to $10.9 million in the prior year period, reflecting higher sales volumes. Weighted average variable costs, excluding biomass, were 15% lower primarily as a result of lower fuel costs and shorter hauling distances, partially offset by increased contractor rates.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $5.0 million compared to $2.7 million in the prior year period and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30% compared to 20% in the prior year period as a result of higher operating income.\n\nDuring the first half of 2023, New Brunswick Timberlands' sales of $34.5 million were 9% higher than the prior year period. The weighted average selling price, excluding biomass, increased 15%, however, sales volume, excluding biomass, decreased 9% year-over-year due to contractor availability noted previously. Operating costs and expenses of $25.2 million during the first half of 2023 were $0.9 million higher than the prior year period, due primarily to increased contractor rates. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.9 million compared to $7.4 million in the first half of 2022, and Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 29% from 23%.\n\nMaine Timberlands\n\nThe table below summarizes operating and financial results for Maine Timberlands.\n\nThree Months EndedSix Months Ended June 24, 2023June 25, 2022June 24, 2023June 25, 2022Harvest (000s m3) Softwood 27.7 19.5 57.0 96.6Hardwood 10.7 5.4 26.2 27.7Biomass - 3.0 6.5 3.2Total 38.4 27.9 89.7 127.5Sales (000s m3) Softwood 24.0 19.7 52.2 96.6Hardwood 12.7 10.8 28.1 31.5Biomass - 3.0 6.5 3.2Total 36.7 33.5 86.8 131.3Sales Mix Softwood 65% 59% 60% 74%Hardwood 35% 32% 32% 24%Biomass - 9% 8% 2%Total 100% 100% 100% 100%Results ($000s) Softwood $2,737$ 1,662$5,373$ 8,449Hardwood 1,182 1,127 2,734 2,853Biomass - 6 60 10Total $3,919$ 2,795$8,167$ 11,312Timber services and other 219 154 426 259Sales $ 4,138$ 2,949$8,593$ 11,571Adjusted EBITDA $1,133$ 364$2,232$ 3,116Adjusted EBITDA margin 27% 12% 26% 27%\n\nSales for Maine Timberlands during the second quarter totaled $4.1 million compared to $2.9 million in the prior year period. Sales volume, excluding biomass, increased 20% reflecting an earlier start to operations and increased contractor availability, as compared to the same period in the prior year.\n\nIn U.S dollar terms, the weighted average selling price, excluding biomass, was $79.55 per m3, compared to $71.39 per m3 during the same period of 2022, driven primarily by higher softwood sawlog prices benefiting from favourable market dynamics. The weighted average selling price, excluding biomass, in Canadian dollar terms was $106.92 per m3, compared to $91.13 per m3 during the same period of 2022, being further impacted by foreign exchange rates.\n\nOperating costs and expenses for the second quarter were $3.1 million, compared to $2.6 million during the same period in 2022, reflecting higher harvesting activity. Weighted average variable costs, excluding biomass, increased 5% primarily as a result of higher contractor rates.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.1 million compared to $0.4 million in the prior year period and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 27%, up from 12% in the prior year period.\n\nDuring the first half of 2023, Maine Timberlands' sales were $8.6 million compared to $11.6 million in the first half of 2022. Maine Timberlands' weighted average selling price, excluding biomass, increased 14% in Canadian dollar terms, and 8% in U.S. dollar terms, however sales volume, excluding biomass, was 37% lower. Operating costs and expenses of $6.5 million during the first half of 2023 were $2.0 million lower than the prior year period, as a result of lower harvesting activity partially offset by higher contractor rates.\n\nOutlook\n\nNorth American inflation concerns persist, and interest rates continue to increase, which has put near-term pressure on end use markets. However, we remain confident that the stability of the northeastern forestry sector, combined with the long-term demand for new homes and repair and remodel activity, will support the demand for our products. Consensus forecast for U.S. housing starts has risen to approximately 1.37 million starts in 2023.\n\nWe experienced increased contractor availability during the second quarter and expect to maintain this capacity throughout the remainder of the year. Inflation continues to impact our financial results through elevated contractor rates and fuel surcharges.\n\nDemand for Acadian's sawlogs is mainly driven by regional supply and demand, meaning that the stable demand experienced in the first half of 2023 is expected to continue. Pricing for softwood sawtimber is expected to remain stable, however, pricing for hardwood sawtimber may weaken, reflecting the recent weakness in hardwood lumber pricing. While regional inventories of hardwood pulpwood have been replenished and demand has begun to slow, this market is expected to remain stable. Softwood pulpwood markets are expected to remain at the improved levels experienced in 2022.\n\nQuarterly Dividend\n\nBased on a strong balance sheet and outlook for the remainder of the year, Acadian is pleased to announce a dividend of $0.29 per share, payable on October 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on September 30, 2023.\n\nAcadian Timber Corp. is one of the largest timberland owners in Eastern Canada and the Northeastern U.S. and has a total of approximately 2.4 million acres of land under management. Acadian owns and manages approximately 761,000 acres of freehold timberlands in New Brunswick, approximately 300,000 acres of freehold timberlands in Maine and provides timber services relating to approximately 1.3 million acres of Crown licensed timberlands in New Brunswick. Acadian's products include softwood and hardwood sawlogs, pulpwood and biomass by-products, sold to approximately 90 regional customers.\n\nAcadian's business strategy is to maximize cash flows from its existing timberland assets through sustainable forest management and other land use activities while growing its business by acquiring assets and actively managing these assets to drive improved performance.\n\nAcadian's shares are listed for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol ADN.\n\nFor further information, please visit our website at www.acadiantimber.com or contact:\n\nSusan Wood\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nTel: 506-737-2345\n\nEmail: ir@acadiantimber.com\n\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information and Statements\n\nThis News Release contains forward-looking information and statements within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Acadian Timber Corp. and its subsidiaries (collectively, \"Acadian\"), or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

        "body": "On a daily basis, as international flights arrive the airport, it has become a recurrent decimal to see many passengers having landed safely at the airport use all manner of unprintable words to express how disgusting they are with the dilapidated infrastructures scattered all over the airport\n\nIn the recent past, so many Nigerians particularly those in the diaspora who formed the major bulk of air travellers coming from different parts of the world through the Murtala Muhamed International airport, Lagos have continued to express disappointment at the infrastructural decay adorning the number one gateway airport in the country.\n\nOn a daily basis, as international flights arrive the airport, it has become a recurrent decimal to see many passengers having landed safely at the airport use all manner of unprintable words to express how disgusting they are with the dilapidated infrastructures scattered all over the airport.\n\nFor travellers flying into the Lagos airport from places like Europe, America or Middle East, the first horror awaiting them is the stench that oozes out of the old and unkempt toilets therein which do not befit the status of any international airport even at smaller airports in neighbouring countries.\n\nRelated Posts Law establishing institute for environmental practitioners gazette Common herbal tonic for pain in pregnancy contributes to male infertility -- Study Adoption and your emotional well-being (1)\n\nBesides the defaced toilets lacking essential needs like tissue papers, air fresheners and soaps, many of the WC toilet systems installed there have changed colour due to old age and overuse.\n\nApart from the stress you will be made to pass through in the hands of the immigration officials who may keep you standing on the queue for the same hours it takes you to fly for example from places like London to Lagos to have your passport stamped, more troubles await you in the hands of the other different uniform personnel whose major aim is to exploit you.\n\nIf you manage to pass through these hurdles, God help you if you are not faced with bigger problems as you walk to the baggage claim area where you can be subjected to a fresh hassles of having to wait endlessly for the carousel to bring your luggage out.\n\nAt times, owing to the over flogging of the carousel otherwise known as conveyor belt, count yourself lucky if you are able to collect your luggage without it breaking down midway due to over usage.\n\nIn other climes, an international airport like the MMIA should have alternative carousels that can conveniently handle passengers luggage particularly during the peak periods when there may likely be multiple flights landing at the same time.\n\nEven the cooling systems that cost Nigeria several millions of naira to install are not faring better especially towards evening when most foreign carriers come in to pick their passengers out of the country as passengers sweat profusely while they await their flights.\n\nSometimes, it's either the entire environment suddenly goes into darkness or the essential areas at the peak of passengers' profiling due to obsolete cables some of which were installed as far back as 1979 when the Lagos airport was built after the Schiphol airport which has been rebuilt many times by the Dutch government.\n\nThe problems of the deplorable state of the number one gateway airport have remained a rocket science for the subsequent ministers of aviation to resolve despite the huge funds often allocated to the sector to address infrastructural deficits.\n\nFor any traveller landing at the Lagos airport for the first time, the number one thing to observe is an archaic structure housing both the arrival and departure terminals adorned with old facilities that have been overflogged due to many years of existence.\n\nMany Nigerians including air travelers had described the status of the Lagos airport as a national disgrace in view of the unpleasant attendant pains it brings to seamless air transport.\n\nLittle wonder how, in the recent past, passengers have been bombarding the different social media spaces with tales of their experiences on landing or departing the country through the airport.\n\nMany of the aggrieved passengers who have complained that they are not getting the value for the huge funds they pay, lamented that the kind of outdated facilities adorning the airport were not commensurate to what they pay for their tickets and other services.\n\nA passenger with the social media handle @o_aisien once exclaimed at what she witnessed at the airport saying: \"I was ashamed to say the least. Experts flying into Nigeria and this is what greets them? It's appalling, the aviation minister should be held accountable@faanofficial@jidesanwoolu\".\n\nAnother passenger with the twitter handle @lolashoneyin gave an embarrassing details of what she saw at the Lagos international airport when she saw off her relative travelling out through the airport when she narrated how she saw bowls of different sizes spread on the floor to collect rains water dropping from the leaking roofs.\n\nDescribing the Lagos airport as a place of shame for all Nigerians as a people even as she declared that the shenanigans going on there defy any logical explanations, the airport user remarked: \"Is there or are there some people actually paid to manage this airport? Are they guided by any KPI ? I understand that they may be incapacitated by financing and all sorts of vested interests, but there are some minimum things like keeping order and keeping the place safe and clean, that they can at least do.\n\nI saw a relative off to the airport and right from the door, passing through the screening machine, the agency staff on duty were too busy trying to see who or how they could fleece passengers coming in, that you could carry any dangerous weapons through them and they won't notice.\n\nThe entire place is run down, the check-in counters are all broken down, worn, the counter tops, tables are falling apart, the conveyor belts that are supposed take the luggage away to the aircraft are broken down and so they cart the luggage away in some kind of trolley.\n\nThe toilets are an eyesore! The water cisterns are broken, the toilet roll holders and toilet rolls don't exist. You will see the cleaner holding the toilet roll though, and they greet effusively so you understand you have to drop something for the use of the t/roll.\n\nPassing through on another occasion, the arrival hall was worse, a passenger's nightmare. The luggage carousels are worn, some of the flabs are half torn off, even the part constructed during Stella Oduah's time as minister was so badly done that everything is already falling apart. It was definitely not done by anyone with requisite skills or exposure to work on a project of that class or scope.\n\nNow, let's talk about the jetway, what a shame, It is either dripping water all over the place when it's raining or it's so dark because the bulbs or fluorescent have all burnt out and passengers just have to manage and grope in the dark with whatever little light is available and then try to dodge the puddles of water on the jetway floor.\n\nThe pre boarding areas of some gates also don't have working florescent or bulb and so the whole place is dark and dingy looking.\n\nAre there people paid every month to run the airport. Do they have an engineering department that sees to daily maintenance, faulty bulbs, bad luggage carousels, leaky roofs, bad toilet faucet etc?!Or are passengers just at the mercy of the Nigerian system.\n\nThe entire departure hall was so filthy and there was not a single cleaner in sight, cleaning, as you would find in other airports across the world. It was so filthy that I cannot compare it to anything I've seen anywhere else.\"\n\nThe lamentation of this airport user which captures the daily bad experiences suffered by travellers at the airport however puts question marks on some of the past ministers of aviation that had been put in charge of managing the airports.\n\nA Canada bound passenger who spoke to Tribune while awaiting his flight on Wednesday, expressed disgust for the state of the airport.\n\nIn conclusion, he said if nothing is done to fix the deficits that passengers may, one of these days, initiate what he called a class suit action against the Nigerian government for failing to justify the huge funds they pay through the taxes taken from them on the tickets they purchase.\n\nReactions aviation key players:\n\nFor the immediate past President of Aviation Safety Round Table (ASRT), Dr Gabriel Olowo, the Lagos international airport is a national disgrace and therefore, called for the immediate stripping or pulling down of the facility and rebuilding another one.\n\nAccording to him; \"Murtala Muhammed International Airport, which is Nigeria's number one airport built in 1978, should be shut down, stripped 100 percent and rebuilt. It remains a national disgrace and an eyesore when speaking about the world's contemporary modern airports. Fingers A, B and C as in the original masterplan should be added like yesterday. Aerotropolis can then come to compliment the aerotropolis.\"\n\nFor one of the leading labour leaders in the sector' Comrade OlayinkaAbioye, the Lagos international airport requires a complete rehabilitation \"as if we are building a new airport. No matter the repair that is carried out, it will be wasted resources.\n\nThere is hardly any part of that building that is not sick and require surgical emergency.\n\n\"So, my take is rather than pull down the entire structure, we need to do it phase by phase. Start from one wing of the terminal, dismantle all that are dismantleable and fix them. Afterwards, start from another wing and within one year, we shall be good to go. For security reasons I will refrain from saying some things but we need a holistic approach in dealing with MMIA.\"\n\nDeplorable Lagos airport blamed on corruption:\n\nTo show their anger, many stakeholders have blamed the deplorable structures at the airport on the alleged corruption perpetrated by of many of the previous ministers. According to a former military commandant of the airport, Group Captain John Ojikutu (retired), \"That airpot alone generates minimum of 50% of the total FAAN annual earnings, unfortunately, institutional corruptions have been on the way against the periodic maintenance of the infrastructure and the facilities.\"\n\nIt is on record that among the ministers that had been appointed to manage the sector, the one that graciously have more than enough access to funds, part of which could have been used to fix the infrastructural deficit but ignored it was the immediate past minister, Senator HadiSirika.\n\nSirika rather than use part of the huge funds allocated to his ministry to fix the critical aspects of the airport failing structures, concentrated on unnecessary projects such as the national carrier and airports concession.\n\nThe previous ministers that came before Sirika also failed in this aspect as they came and left the infrastructures at the Lagos airport and other major international airports unattended to. The only one that tried a bit was Stella Oduah through her airport remodeling policy.\n\nTo many key players, there is no way the number one gateway airport should be in this mess in view of the fact that the airport alone generate minimum of 50 percent of the total FAAN annual earnings.\n\nAt the rate the facilities at the airport breaks down, many airport users are of the opinion that if the President Bola Ahmed Tinubu government through the National Assembly fails to declare state of emergency at the Lagos airport and most others across the country, Nigerians may wake one day to see that the entire structure built in 1979 has caved in leaving the country with the alternative new terminal commissioned over a year ago but sadly with structural error which has made it unattractive to foreign airlines.\n\nAccording to some airport workers who spoke to Aviation Tribune, if the government fails to fix the dilapidated structures, this may force passengers particularly the international ones from shunning the Lagos airport which may drastically affect the revenue generation of FAAN and subsequently rubbish all efforts to make the Lagos airport a hub for the region.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Nigerian Tribune Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

        "body": "Buoyant lettings activity in the UK capital's tight rental market boosted earnings at London-based estate agency Foxtons, offsetting a slowdown in house sales in the first half of the year.\n\nFoxtons posted pre-tax profits of \u00a36.1mn in the six months to the end of June, up from \u00a34.3mn a year earlier. Lettings revenue rose 26 per cent in the same period, offsetting a 19 per cent drop in sales revenue caused by higher mortgage costs.\n\nThe agency, which has more than 27,000 tenancies, said on Thursday it expected \"little change\" to the \"supply and demand imbalance\" that had driven up rent in London, but expected the pace of rent rises to cool in the second half of the year.\n\nIntense competition for a reduced pool of London homes has accelerated as interest rates have risen, while soaring borrowing costs have hit demand from buyers and sellers.\n\n\"The continued growth in the imbalance between supply and demand is at the highest levels we have ever seen,\" Foxtons said. \"This continues to drive rents and is making it more difficult for renters to find affordable accommodation in London.\"\n\nFoxtons has in the last year sought to increase its activity in the rental market, which it sees as more resilient to economic downturns than sales. Lettings made up 70 per cent of the estate agent's revenue in the first half of the year, compared with 61 per cent in 2022.\n\n\"Our continued focus on growing non-cyclical and recurring revenues is working and has enabled us to deliver strong revenue and profit growth despite a challenging sales market,\" said chief executive Guy Gittins.\n\nThe group said it had received fewer buyer inquiries in July because of the rising cost of borrowing. Mortgage rates, which had been climbing in recent months, soared after the Bank of England raised its benchmark interest rate to 5 per cent in June.\n\nFoxtons, which was founded in the 1980s in London, said mortgage refinancing volumes jumped 29 per cent in the first half and it expected the trend to continue throughout the year. However, overall revenue at its financial services business fell 12 per cent as customers took smaller loans and made fewer new purchases.\n\nFoxtons said that although it expected an increase in house sales in the third quarter, inflation and high borrowing costs would continue to hit transactions throughout the year.\n\nThe group's board announced a half-year dividend of 0.2p a share. Shares in the agency rose 3 per cent in early trading on Thursday.",

        "body": "A general view of the Egyptian stock exchange in Cairo August 18, 2013. Egypt's stock market fell sharply on Sunday as it resumed trading after hundreds of people were killed in a crackdown by the army-backed government on supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood. Banks and the stock market reopened for the first time since Wednesday's carnage, with shares rapidly falling 2.5 percent. REUTERS/Louafi Larbi (EGYPT - Tags: POLITICS CIVIL UNREST BUSINESS)\n\nThe Egyptian Exchange (EGX) decided Wednesday to stop the EGX50 EWI index, as of 1 August.\n\nWithin the framework of the Egyptian Exchange's direction towards permanent updating and continuous development of market indicators to ensure the diversification of tools for measuring market performance in front of different categories of investors, and within the framework of continuous review of current market indicators and studying the components of each of them and the extent of its uniqueness and uniqueness of its methodology from other indicators and studying the extent to which all elements of the market benefit out of every index, the Egyptian Exchange saw that the EGX50 EWI index is the least used.\n\nThe Egyptian Exchange - desiring to know the opinion of all market elements - conducted an opinion poll for a group of 17 investment research centers, asset management companies and investment funds. It was clear from the results of the survey that the EGX50 EWI index is one of the least used indicators The survey revealed that they rarely use the index data or do not use it at all, at a rate of 94%, and most of them saw that it is the most appropriate index that the Egyptian Exchange can stop working with.",

        "title": "How to bridge data silos and enable cloud-like efficiency",
        "body": "Sponsored Feature Modern business decisions rely on intelligent data rather than assumptions. To make informed operational and business choices, organizations amass and store vast amounts of data.\n\nData-driven insights can significantly benefit supply chain management, resource allocation, process optimization, and understanding customer preferences. Personalized business experiences are now expected by 71 percent of consumers, and leveraging valuable data insights can meet this demand. Studies indicate that enhancing the customer experience can boost sales revenues by 2-7 percent and profitability by 1-2 percent.\n\nHowever, businesses struggle to unify data into a single source of truth. Many organizations face challenges in establishing innovative, data-driven processes.\n\nA recent Statista survey of 116 businesses worldwide reveals that many firms still struggle to establish innovative, data-driven organizations. This becomes problematic as digital transformations proceed without sufficient data intelligence. Data silos, inadequate infrastructure to handle growing data volumes, and unstructured data impede the unlocking of data's full potential.\n\nThe exponential growth of data, estimated to be twice as large by 2025, further compounds the issue. Merely collecting and storing data is insufficient; the real challenge lies in extracting meaningful insights for strategic decision-making.\n\nCommon hurdles in unlocking data value and intelligence include:\n\n- Multiple data silos: Silos obstruct data availability and value, necessitating their dismantling to facilitate data access, security, sharing, and collaboration.\n\n- Inadequate infrastructure for high data volumes: Existing on-premises infrastructure may lack the processing power and storage capacity required. Moving resources to the cloud is an option, but it can be costly and complex. Hybrid solutions have gained popularity.\n\n- Unstructured data: Scattered across various locations and formats, unstructured data is difficult to integrate, organize, analyze, and gain insights from.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a robust data management solution that aggregates data from silos, offers valuable insights regardless of storage location, and automates processes using AI. Let's explore how Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) GreenLake provides such a solution.\n\nWave goodbye to data silos\n\nHPE GreenLake, an edge-to-cloud platform, enables data-first modernization through various services. By integrating existing infrastructures with cloud resources, organizations can adopt a cloud-like experience without full migration. The platform allows businesses to maximize their edge investments while capitalizing on cloud scalability, agility, and innovation.\n\nThe platform also analyzes data wherever it resides, to address cost and complexity concerns associated with sending, storing, and analyzing data in the cloud. It eliminates data silos and empowers organizations to extract real-time insights from their operations, delivering a holistic view of their data-driven insights.\n\nWith this approach, companies can also apply the same data management policies, rules and deployments across their on-premise and cloud environments with minimal overhead.\n\nOffered on a self-service, pay-as-you-go model, HPE GreenLake provides businesses with control over accessing and consuming services. The automated self-service functionality enables provisioning, configuration, and management of IT resources according to specific requirements.\n\nThe pay-as-you-go model eliminates upfront capital expenditures, allowing businesses to scale resources based on demand and align IT spending with operational needs.\n\nHPE GreenLake gives customers the opportunity to get a true picture of activities across their hybrid estate by offering an analytics dashboard that can display key features, such as consumption analytics, continuous regulatory compliance monitoring, and fast provisioning.\n\n\"Businesses now have the opportunity to use the HPE GreenLake Cloud Portal (GLCP), which is designed to harmonize all the assets owned by a company into a single pane, which can be fed over time into an analytics backend, allowing businesses to have an overview of how their data is performing,\" says Williams.\n\nSeveral case studies highlight how HPE GreenLake adoption has helped companies sustain business growth through data intelligence.\n\nIn summary, data is a valuable resource, but its true worth lies in the insights it provides. HPE GreenLake aims to bridge data silos and enable cloud-like efficiency within on-premises infrastructure. By maintaining control, governance, security, and familiarity, organizations can achieve data-first business transformation.",

        "title": "How SHEIN Uses Global Footprint to Drive Local Impact",
        "body": "(BPT) - While SHEIN may be synonymous with affordable online shopping, local shoppers in Indianapolis were recently treated to a first-hand look at the brand's products through a 4-day pop-up event. Customers browsed the physical retail space, interacting with exclusive SHEIN products they would typically only be able to shop online. In the past year, SHEIN has hosted multiple pop-ups around the world.\n\nConnecting with local communities is an integral part of the online brand's strategy. For a company as large and globally connected as SHEIN, it's vital to use that market power for the greater good of the fashion industry as a whole and invest in the communities that customers and creators call home.\n\nIn May 2023, SHEIN formed a partnership with Girls Inc. of Greater Indianapolis, the central Indiana chapter of the nationwide non-profit organization. Girls Inc. Indy empowers girls, from ages 6 to 24, with evidence-based programming to support their whole selves, providing guidance and mentorship to nurture their strengths. SHEIN partnered with Girls Inc. Indy to support their 2023 STEM summer camp, an educational program for local high school girls to broaden their horizons in science, technology, engineering and math. SHEIN team members presented on multiple STEM disciplines, showing the campers a glimpse of the wide breadth of STEM careers they could pursue.\n\nParticipants of the Girls Inc. Indy program were invited to SHEIN's pop-up activation in Indianapolis, joining 3,500 fans, all able to shop various collections from the brand. Local designer Tendai Phillips also made a special appearance at the event. Originally from Zimbabwe, Phillips moved to the U.S. and earned her degree from The Art Institute of Indianapolis. Her collection, SHEIN x Redefinition, is part of the SHEIN X Design Incubator program that gives independent designers and artists around the world the tools they need to share their brand with customers across global markets. \"SHEIN X changed my future in the fashion industry by giving me a platform where I could express my creativity and share it with the rest of the world,\" explained Phillips. \"This is something that would have taken me time to build and bridge that gap between my brand and the rest of the world.\"\n\nSince kicking off SHEIN X in January 2021, SHEIN has invested over $55 million in the program and brought over 3,000 designers' original collections to market. More than half of SHEIN X designers are based in the U.S., spread across 47 states. SHEIN X designers receive production, distribution, and marketing support to take their designs from paper to the global SHEIN site. Programs like this are vital to ensure the next generation of talent has the best tools at their disposal to be successful in the industry.\n\nWhile the fashion industry continues to quickly evolve, it's exciting to see a large global brand, like SHEIN, keep individual communities at the heart of their impact. By localizing operations, including the recent establishment of facilities in locations like Brazil, SHEIN helps prove that it's possible to prioritize supporting local communities that are passionate about fashion to bring the newest trends to local customers and support designers in developing tomorrow's favorites.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

        "body": "Luxury Real Estate: Maintaining a strong sales momentum, the luxury housing segment in India registered a 130 per cent y-o-y surge across top-7 cities during the January-June 2023 period. The total sales of luxury housing units during the period stood at 6,900, compared with 3,000 units during the year-ago period, according to a report by real estate consultant CBRE South Asia.\n\nIn terms of sales, Delhi-NCR topped with sales of 2,900-unit, marking a 205 per cent Y-o-Y increase, followed by Mumbai, which recorded sales of 1,900-units, an 18 per cent Y-o-Y growth\n\n\"Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, and Hyderabad emerged as prominent markets, combined together accounting for nearly 90 per cent of the total luxury housing sales across top-7 cities,\" CBRE said in the report, titled 'India Market Monitor Q2 2023'.\n\nIt added that Hyderabad recorded the highest percentage increase in sales on a Y-o-Y basis during January-June 2023, with nearly 14-fold growth with total sales of 1,400 units. This was followed by a nearly six-fold increase in sales in Pune and over three-fold jump in Delhi-NCR on a y-o-y basis.\n\n\"In terms of the quantum of sales of luxury residential units, Delhi-NCR topped with sales of 2,900-unit, marking a 205 per cent Y-o-Y increase; followed by Mumbai, which recorded sales of 1,900-units, an 18 per cent Y-o-Y growth; while sales in Kolkata stood at 200 units, a 100 per cent Y-o-Y increase; and Pune recorded sale of 300-units, registering a 500 per cent Y-o-Y increase during this period,\" CBRE said in the report.\n\nA similar trend prevailed during the April-June 2023 quarter in the luxury housing segment across the top cities registering a 121 per cent y-o-y increase in sales. The quarter saw total sales of 3,100 luxury housing units, compared with 1,400 units during the same quarter last year.\n\nAmong the cities, Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, and Hyderabad emerged as prominent markets during the quarter, while luxury sales in Hyderabad increased by 20 times, it jumped three-fold in Delhi-NCR.\n\n\"The surge in demand for luxury housing was primarily driven by a growing preference for enhanced amenities and more spacious living areas. Moreover, it is the aspirational class that has been on an upward trend and driving luxury sales. Besides, the rise in NRI investments in the Indian real estate market has significantly contributed to the heightened demand for luxury properties,\" it said.\n\nOverall, in the residential sector, during January-June 2023 period, a total of 154,000 units were sold, and over 151,000 new units were launched across all categories. During the January-June 2023 period, sales increased by about 3 per cent compared to the same period a year ago, whereas new launches recorded a growth of 9 per cent y-o-y basis, highlighting a substantial rise in the newly launched residential properties compared to the corresponding period in the previous year.\n\nAnshuman Magazine, chairman and CEO (India, South-East Asia, Middle East & Africa) of CBRE, said, \"We are witnessing an impressive growth and resilience of the luxury housing segment, as evident from the data showing a remarkable 130 per cent increase in sales. This surge signifies the strong demand and positive momentum in the luxury housing market. Looking ahead, we anticipate a stronger second half of 2023 in the residential market, supported by factors such as a healthy supply pipeline, the approaching festive season, and stabilising mortgage rates.\"\n\nHe added that despite global macroeconomic challenges, the residential sector is expected to maintain robust sales momentum. Additionally, the premium and luxury segments are expected to perform well with new launches, and the volatility in mortgage rates on demand in this segment is anticipated to be limited.",

The 2-year Treasury yield was less than one basis point higher at 4.8308%.\n\nYields and prices move in opposite directions and one basis point equal 0.01%.\n\nInvestors weighed what could be next for interest rates and the U.S. economy after the Fed announced a further 25 basis point rate hike on Wednesday after its latest meeting ended.\n\nIn a press conference on Wednesday, Powell said there was a possibility of both further rate hikes and holding rates at the current level when policymakers next meet in September. He added that these decisions would continue to be data-dependent.\n\n\"We're going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting,\" Powell said.\n\nMany investors have been hoping that the Fed will end its rate-hiking campaign soon as concerns about elevated rates leading the U.S. economy into a recession have taken hold.\n\nThe central bank chief on Wednesday also addressed the outlook for inflation, indicating that despite easing pressures from rising prices, there's still \"a long way to go\" before inflation returns to the Fed's 2% target.\n\nThe last consumer price index print came in at 3% on an annual basis. Investors will get fresh insights on Friday, when the personal consumption expenditures price index for June is due.\n\nOn Thursday, a preliminary reading of the gross domestic product for the second quarter is expected, as are June's durable goods orders and home sales figures and the latest weekly initial jobless claims data.\n\nElsewhere, the European Central Bank is due to announce an interest rate decision on Thursday, with markets anticipating another rate hike.",

The unveiling of this special stamp reinforces ITC's commitment to promoting the sustainable cultivation and consumption of millets in everyday foods, as the initiative not only supports the environment but also provides nutritious food options for the people of India.\n\nMillets are a diverse group of small-seeded grains, including sorghum, pearl millet, finger millet, foxtail millet, and others, which have been cultivated for thousands of years and play a vital role in the diets of many communities worldwide. The International Year of Millets 2023, declared by the United Nations, marks a crucial milestone in recognizing the value of millets as a key solution to several pressing global challenges.\n\nThis initiative aims to raise awareness about the unique attributes of millets and their immense potential to contribute to food security, nutrition, and sustainable agriculture.\n\nBy promoting millets as part of a balanced diet, the International Year of Millets seeks to address malnutrition and enhance food and nutrition security worldwide. During this special year, countries are encouraged to implement policies and initiatives that support millets' production, processing, marketing, and consumption.\n\nITC have been empowering farmers with knowledge of soil, crop, and farming techniques, and assisting them in achieving better production, thus enhancing their livelihoods.

The 'Shree Anna' stamp brings to life the importance of millets in both agriculture and food.\n\nThe stamp features captivating sketch illustrations that showcase ITC Ltd.'s dedication to promote the cultivation & consumption of millets. It beautifully captures the journey of millets from Indian farms to ITC's food production factories, where they are transformed into nutritious dishes prepared by expert chefs from ITC Hotels.\n\nThe earthy colours used in the illustrations are inspired by Mission Millets logo, symbolizing millets as the golden crop of India. The stamp also highlights the Government of India's focus on nutrition and its seven guiding principles for the Indian Millets Mission 2023, celebrating the International Year of Millets. To emphasize this connection, the stamp design thoughtfully incorporates the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav logo.\n\nConnecting Agriculture, Food and Heritage\n\nThe 'Shree Anna' stamp stands out as a truly distinctive initiative that celebrates the significance of millets in both agriculture and food, while also incorporating the heritage of the country.\n\nYou can also show your support for millet revolution in India by owning a piece of history, the limited-edition digital collective stamps.

The travel ban was announced on Thursday in a Facebook post from the Ocean Affairs Council Minister Kuan Bi-ling (\u7ba1\u78a7\u73b2).\n\nThe container ship, known as the Angel, sank while anchored near the port of Kaohsiung for unknown reasons on July 20, and all 19 crew members were able to abandon the ship. The Taiwan International Ports Corporation (TIPC) stated that oil-stop lines and oil-absorbing cotton ropes were deployed to contain and prevent oil pollution. As of Thursday, 233 of the Angel's 1,349 empty containers have been hauled ashore, while 977 sank with the ship, according to TIPC.\n\nKuan says that in the event of a ship accident, Taiwanese law stipulates that shipowners must immediately take measures to prevent, eliminate, or reduce any marine pollution. She says the captain of the Angel did not take preventative actions, and that the burden of the cleanup was borne by the Taiwanese government. Kuan says that the costs of cleanup as well as losses to fishermen caused by the pollution are to be borne by the polluter. She adds that the shipowner should come forward and deal with the situation as soon as possible.",

        "body": "The latest Sims 4 expansion, Horse Ranch, has debuted with more of a sluggish trot than a hefty gallop. It's fair to say most of us Simmers have fatigue when it comes to DLC for the game, but with this one it feels more pronounced than ever. Why should we fork out another hefty fee for more content for a game that's nearly 10 years old? We're so tired, EA. Tired and skint. Of course, Sims 4 Horse Ranch is no masterpiece - here's everything the pack should have done better.\n\nEvery time horses have been in Sims games previously, players can also make their horse a unicorn. In The Sims 4 Horse Ranch pack, EA have let players just put a unicorn hat on their horses. Brilliant.\n\nOne of the big gameplay elements of Sims 4 Horse Ranch expansion pack is that the main competitions you can do with your horses is just a rabbit hole experience. Players don't get to do anything gameplay wise, it's completely shallow. The best thing you can do is watch your Sim trot about on their horse. This is an EXPANSION PACK, not a game pack. I want my game to feel enriched, not have a little sheen over it. It feels money making.\n\nShock. SHOCK. This is meant to be a family ranch gameplay pack not just adults! Give us some kids and toddlers clothes I beg.\n\nCottage Living enhances Horse Ranch but like, Cottage Living gives me all the farm fun I need. I'm not a horse girly, so maybe this pack is just not for me - but I really think we're better than this and think we could have more originality. This used to come bundled in with pets, so why are we spending so much and splitting packs up?\n\nSo annoying... Just go in your stable, babe. They're on their own agenda and it's frustrating.\n\n* Every expansion pack for The Sims 4 ranked, including the brand new Growing Together\n\n* Everything wrong with Growing Together, The Sims 4's new expansion pack",

        "title": "England hopes to be sharper in its next Women's World Cup match after underwhelming opener | TSN",
        "body": "AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Katie Robinson knows England left many unimpressed with its underwhelming 1-0 victory against overmatched Haiti in its opening match at the Women's World Cup.\n\nEngland is still tied with Denmark atop the Group D standings, regardless of how they played against Haiti, and that's all that really counts to Robinson.\n\n\"Every game at a World Cup is going to be difficult,\" Robinson said. \"Most importantly, we got the three points, and that's all that matters right now.\"\n\nWell, what actually matters next is Friday's match against Denmark in Sydney, where the top spot in the group is up for grabs as both teams try to advance to the knockout round. It is the first meeting between the two teams at the Women's World Cup, although they faced off three previous times at the European Championship.\n\nEngland defeated Denmark twice in 1984, but the Danes were the winner in 2005, the last time the two nations faced in international play. They met in a friendly in 2019, won by England 2-0.\n\nDenmark is back at the World Cup for the first time since 2007 and beat China 1-0 in its opening game.\n\nEngland understands it must pick up its play against Denmark, which is ranked 13th in the world and a far tougher opponent than Haiti.\n\n\"We're all working really hard in training to make sure we're a bit more clinical, creating more chances and obviously getting our goal percentage higher. We know it's something that we need to improve on,\" England forward Lauren Hemp said. \"We are working really hard as a team to make sure that we're ready for the game against Denmark and ready to score some goals.\"\n\nEngland is ranked fourth in the world and the reigning European champions. The Lionesses won all six of their games to win the tournament they hosted last year.\n\nBut England has not scored a goal in open play since the 23rd minute of the Women's Finalissima against Brazil on April 6 -- a span of 367 minutes.\n\n\"Heading into the World Cup, we've shown that we're dominant against a lot of teams, so we just need to be a bit more clinical and have those percentages rise in the next game,\" Hemp said.\n\nDenmark pulled out the win over China when substitute Amalie Vangsgaard scored in the 90th minute to give the Danes their sixth win in their last seven international matches. Denmark had a clean sheet in five of those games.\n\nThe Danes did not advance out of the group stage in their last two tournament appearances, but a win over England would make them the likely Group D winners. Denmark has never won two matches at a single Women's World Cup before.\n\nARGENTINA-SOUTH AFRICA\n\nHildah Magaia will play for South Africa, which believes it has a chance to win its first Women's World Cup game when it plays Argentina.\n\nMagaia scored for South Africa in its tournament opener, but was injured on the play and couldn't finish the game. Sweden went on to win 2-1, but the performance gave the South Africans confidence they can get a victory.\n\nArgentina dropped a 1-0 opener to Italy.\n\n\"Knowing that we went toe-to-toe with the No. 3 country in the world and it took a superhuman effort from them to get the result, we're very positive for the next two matches,\" South Africa coach Desiree Ellis said after the Sweden loss. \"We're not underestimating the teams, but we know our capabilities.\"\n\nMagaia and her coach both said she would \"definitely\" be able to play against Argentina.\n\nCHINA-HAITI\n\nChina and Haiti were both disappointed by opening-game losses and next face off to stay alive in Group D in a match scheduled for Adelaide, Australia.\n\nChina probably thought it would open the tournament with a win over Denmark and instead lost 1-0.\n\nChina has been to the knockout round in all six of its previous tournament appearances and probably counted Denmark as an early win. China shouldn't overlook Haiti, which surprised by hanging with European champion England in a 1-0 loss to the Lionesses.\n\nPlaying so well against England was a huge feat for Haiti, which maybe now believes it has a shot at beating China.\n\nHaiti needs to shore up its defense and has been scored on in all eight of its previous international games. But Haiti suffered a blow against England when defender Jennyfer Limage tore her ACL.\n\nChina has never lost consecutive group games in the history of the tournament.\n\n___\n\nAP Women's World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/fifa-womens-world-cup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

He said, \"Today, a bag of urea, which is sold in India at Rs 266, is being sold at Rs 800 in Pakistan, Rs 720 in Bangladesh, Rs 2,100 in China and Rs 3,000 in the US\".

However, the governing body dropped the news that she and Luik had been scratched on Wednesday just as media arrived to view the start of the team's final training session before the match.\n\nWithout both Kerr and Fowler, and with Kyah Simon still recovering from the ACL injury she sustained in October, the Matildas have only Foord as a recognised and available striker.\n\nGustavsson's options now include starting Foord up front with Emily van Egmond or Tameka Yallop, who has recovered from a corked thigh suffered in the Matildas' final friendly against France, or even Alex Chidiac.\n\nGood evening football fans!\n\nWelcome to our live blog for Australia v Nigeria in Brisbane tonight - a must-win game for the Matildas.\n\nIt's been a bumpy week for the Tillies, with Mary Fowler and Aivi Luik both ruled out with concussion (more on that later), but Australians are battlers, and although it's slim pickings for coach Tony Gustavsson when it comes to forwards, I feel confident the team will rise to the occasion.\n\nKick-off is at 8pm AEST on Channel 7, so get your green and gold shirts on and tune in to cheer on the Tillies.",

Amid the backdrop of these cases, the state of human rights and democracy in Pakistan were discussed at the event.\n\nSeveral leaders from the US House of Reps spoke during the event, raising concerns over ongoing human rights violations and the shrinking space for free expression in Pakistan.\n\nTo clarify, Pakistani-American PTI activist Khadija Shah had been arrested for alleged involvement in the arson of Lahore Corp Commander House (Jinnah House) during the May 9 violent protests. On the other hand, Imran Riaz Khan was apprehended by the Police at Sialkot International Airport on May 11 but his current location has been untraceable ever since.\n\nPakistan's recent political chaos following the arrest of PTI Chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan and the subsequent government action sparked international concern.\n\nMembers of the US Congress have been very vocal in their condemnation of the human rights violations in Pakistan. In fact, 66 members of the US Congress also wrote to Secretary of State Blinken, asking him to exert pressure on the Pakistani government in order to address the continually worsening human rights violations in the country.",

Saranno le sonorit\u00e0 siciliane di Roy Paci (21 agosto - Jazz Festival), la Notte Bianca e la Sagra della Spiga gli appuntamenti clou dell'estate gangitana. Eventi tra arte, cultura e spettacolo che testimoniano la bont\u00e0 di un cartellone vario con oltre 40 momenti diversi che si concluderanno ad ottobre. Sintesi perfetta di tanti modi di proporre e trascorrere non solo l'estate.\n\nSi inizia domani (28 luglio), alle ore 21,30, con il primo dei quattro appuntamenti del Jazz Festival, con l'esibizione di Umberto Porcaro \"Take me Home\" - La Notte del Blues. Si continua il 5 agosto con Skillie Charles Orchestra e ancora il 14 agosto con l'esibizione di Giacomo Tantillo-Bandistikamente.\n\nDel ricchissimo carnet di eventi spazio alla solidariet\u00e0 con la terza edizione \"Estate per tutti\". Il suono oltre le barriere, l'appuntamento del 2 agosto di \"Dimensione Uomo\" rivolto ai pi\u00f9 deboli.\n\nIl Forum Giovani, il 4 agosto, propone tutto in una notte per il divertimento dei pi\u00f9 giovani.

        "body": "A produ\u00e7\u00e3o sobre o projeto Manhattan tinha Rachel Brosnahan, David Harbour e outros nomes conhecidos no elenco\n\nA leitura de Christopher Nolan sobre J. Robert Oppenheimer para o cinema vai entrar para a hist\u00f3ria da s\u00e9tima arte. Mas esta n\u00e3o foi a \u00fanica produ\u00e7\u00e3o a explorar o projeto ambicioso do f\u00edsico. Em 2014, a s\u00e9rie \"Manhattan\" se dedicou a essa miss\u00e3o - s\u00f3 que de um jeito diferente.\n\nA s\u00e9rie foi um dos primeiros t\u00edtulos originais da pequena emissora WGN America. Al\u00e9m de abordar o projeto da constru\u00e7\u00e3o da bomba at\u00f4mica, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o mostra o dia a dia, sonhos e segredos dos moradores da cidade de Los Alamos.\n\nLeia mais:\n\nCriada por Sam Shaw (Masters of Sex), a produ\u00e7\u00e3o veio naquele per\u00edodo em que s\u00e9ries \"com cara de cinema\" come\u00e7avam a aparecer com mais frequ\u00eancia na televis\u00e3o.\n\nNa \u00e9poca, a emissora - que faliu em 2021 - buscava se firmar no mercado audiovisual. A inspira\u00e7\u00e3o era o sucesso da AMC, outro canal pequeno que se tornou um gigante gra\u00e7as \u00e0s s\u00e9ries \"Mad Men\", \"Breaking Bad\" e \"The Walking Dead\".\n\nA ideia do roteirista, que logo foi comprada pelos executivos da emissora, foi: um drama \u00edntimo e pessoal sobre os personagens, com narrativa lenta, elenco repleto de bons atores, produ\u00e7\u00e3o impec\u00e1vel e uma boa hist\u00f3ria real para se basear.\n\nA s\u00e9rie acompanha o cientista Frank Winter (John Benjamin Hickey), baseado em Seth Neddermeyer - que aparece em \"Oppenheimer\" na pele de Devon Bostick - um cientista recrutado para trabalhar num projeto secreto e jamais visto antes: o projeto Manhattan.\n\nFrank \u00e9 acompanhado de sua esposa, Liza (Olivia Williams), uma mulher cheia de mist\u00e9rios e que deixou uma importante miss\u00e3o para tr\u00e1s para ficar com o marido na nova cidade. Eles tamb\u00e9m t\u00eam uma filha, n\u00e3o muito explorada e presa ao arqu\u00e9tipo de \"rebelde sem causa\", vivida por Alexia Fast (Jack Reacher).\n\nEmbora a s\u00e9rie tenha como pano de fundo o projeto Manhattan, seu enredo \u00e9 bem mais sobre os personagens - quase todos fict\u00edcios - de Los Alamos do que sobre a constru\u00e7\u00e3o da bomba at\u00f4mica, ou da complicada vida de J. Robert Oppenheimer.\n\nInclusive, o f\u00edsico mal aparece na s\u00e9rie. Aqui, ele \u00e9 vivido por Daniel London, que \u00e9 creditado apenas em oito de 23 epis\u00f3dios.\n\nApesar dos personagens fict\u00edcios, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o aborda fatos hist\u00f3ricos para trazer mais veracidade ao texto - por exemplo, men\u00e7\u00f5es a Albert Einstein, aos planos de seguran\u00e7a do governo e a constru\u00e7\u00e3o da bomba at\u00f4mica.\n\nContudo, o que Shaw fez ao longo de duas temporadas foi utilizar o projeto como pano de fundo para criar uma esp\u00e9cie de \"novela de \u00e9poca\" embalada com aquela premissa de \"sexo, segredos, mentiras e reviravoltas\".\n\nA s\u00e9rie \"Manhattan\" traz um mosaico de personagens interessantes. Uma delas \u00e9 a jovem Abby, interpretada por Rachel Brosnahan (futura Lois Lane da DC), em um dos seus primeiros grandes pap\u00e9is.\n\nCasada com um dos cientistas do projeto, Charlie Isaacs (Ashley Zukerman), Abby, na verdade, \u00e9 secretamente l\u00e9sbica e apaixonada pela amiga, Elodie (Carole Weyers).\n\nN\u00e3o somente ela tinha uma trama pr\u00f3pria, como grande parte da hist\u00f3rias das outras esposas dos cientistas tamb\u00e9m foram contadas.\n\nOutra narrativa digna de destaque \u00e9 a de Helen Prins (Katja Herbers), uma das pouqu\u00edssimas mulheres vistas nos laborat\u00f3rios entre uma reuni\u00e3o e outra.\n\nEla tinha seus grandes segredos e tramas individuais. E funcionou como fio condutor da trama dos outros homens brancos e de jalecos atuando no projeto secreto.\n\nNos \u00faltimos anos, a s\u00e9rie estava encostada nos cat\u00e1logos dos streamings mais avulsos. Agora, ganhou uma onda extra de interesse do p\u00fablico, gra\u00e7as ao novo filme de Christopher Nolan.\n\nAl\u00e9m da s\u00e9rie trazer boas personagens, traz um elenco com nomes bem conhecidos atualmente. Entre eles, est\u00e3o:\n\nCom duas temporadas e 23 epis\u00f3dios no total, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o \u00e9 uma daquelas s\u00e9ries \"obrigat\u00f3rias\". Mas \u00e9 uma boa pedida para quem saiu de \"Oppenheimer\" querendo passar mais tempo neste contexto.",

        "title": "Google Unveils Multimodal Generative AI Model Med-PaLM M for Healthcare",
        "body": "Clinicians express preference for Med-PaLM M reports on chest X-rays over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of cases\n\nGoogle Health, Google Deepmind and Google AI have unveiled Med-PaLM M, a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodes and interprets biomedical data. It can handle various types of medical data, including clinical language, medical images, and genomics, and performs well on a wide range of tasks, all using the same set of model weights.\n\nIt was built by fine tuning and aligning PaLM-E, a language model from Google AI, to the medical field using a specially curated open-source benchmark called MultiMedBench. MultiMedBench consists of 7 biomedical data types and 14 diverse tasks, such as medical question-answering, generating radiology reports, and identifying genomic variations. With over 1 million samples, this benchmark encourages the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.\n\nMed-PaLM M excels in all tasks on MultiMedBench, often outperforming specialist models by a significant margin and even surpassing PaLM-E, proving the importance of adapting the model to biomedical data.\n\nThe key idea behind building a large-scale biomedical AI is to use language as a common framework for different tasks. This allows the AI to combine knowledge from various sources and transfer skills across tasks more effectively.\n\nExcitingly, preliminary evidence suggests that Med-PaLM M can generalise to new medical tasks and concepts and perform multimodal reasoning without specific training. It can accurately identify and describe medical conditions in images using only language-based instructions and prompts, even if it has never seen such cases before.\n\nTo assess the practical use of Med-PaLM M in clinical settings, radiologists evaluated AI-generated reports at different scales. The AI's error rate was found to be comparable to that of radiologists from previous studies, indicating its potential clinical usefulness. The big tech launched the first version of MedPaLM in December, 2022.\n\nRead more: Responsible AI Takes Center Stage at Google I/O Connect\n\nGoogle's Unwavering Commitment to AI in Healthcare\n\nGoogle's Med-PaLM 2, a medical chatbot that answers medical questions, has been a fan favourite since its launch.\n\nMed-PaLM 2 is built upon Google's language model, PaLM 2, and uses LLMs tailored to the medical domain. The AI has demonstrated impressive performance on medical question-answering datasets, achieving high accuracy on the US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)-style questions and the Indian AIIMS and NEET medical examination questions.\n\nGoogle acknowledges the complexity of personalised medical care and recognises that Med-PaLM 2's results may not be generalisable to every medical question-answering setting and audience. The AI is trained on medical Q/A datasets but excludes patients' personal data to adhere to ethical norms.\n\nWhile having access to patients' personal data could enhance Med-PaLM 2's efficiency, privacy concerns are likely to prevent many patients from sharing such information. Google ensures that customers testing Med-PaLM 2 will retain control of their data in encrypted settings, inaccessible to the tech company, and the AI program will not ingest any of that data.",

Patrick Cramer, pr\u00e9sident de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Max Planck, les discussions sur la publication d'une d\u00e9claration \u00e9taient en cours depuis plusieurs mois, et sa publication quelques jours avant le vote de la Knesset est arriv\u00e9e \" juste \u00e0 temps \".\n\n\" Nous voulions montrer notre solidarit\u00e9 avec nos coll\u00e8gues isra\u00e9liens, avec les amis que nous avons en Isra\u00ebl, et des scientifiques de premier plan nous demandaient de les soutenir ou de faire conna\u00eetre notre opinion \", a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 Cramer.\n\nLe \" caract\u00e8re raisonnable \" d\u00e9j\u00e0 mis \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve\n\nLe crit\u00e8re juridique de \" raisonnabilit\u00e9 \" n'est pas seulement th\u00e9orique lorsqu'il s'agit des relations scientifiques germano-isra\u00e9liennes. En 2018, le ministre des Sciences, des Technologies et de l'espace de l'\u00e9poque, Ofer Akunis, avait bloqu\u00e9 la nomination de la professeure Ya\u00ebl Amita\u00ef, chercheuse sur le cerveau \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 Ben Gurion, au conseil consultatif scientifique de la Fondation allemande pour l'Isra\u00ebl parce qu'elle avait sign\u00e9 une p\u00e9tition en 2005 appelant les soldats \u00e0 refuser de servir en Cisjordanie.\n\nAkunis a refus\u00e9 de suivre les conseils du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'\u00e9poque, Avicha\u00ef Mandelblit, et la Cour supr\u00eame a finalement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Akunis de reconsid\u00e9rer sa d\u00e9cision, d\u00e9clarant que son refus de nommer Amita\u00ef sur la base de sa signature de la p\u00e9tition \u00e9tait \" d\u00e9raisonnable \". Finalement, Amita\u00ef a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e par le successeur d'Akunis, Izhar Shay.\n\nLors d'un entretien avec le Times of Israel depuis son bureau de Munich, Cramer a soulign\u00e9 l'importance de la science libre pour l'avenir. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'Isra\u00ebl, une petite puissance mondiale en mati\u00e8re de recherche et d'innovation, \u00e9tait un partenaire essentiel, et ce, depuis que la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9l\u00e9gation scientifique allemande en Isra\u00ebl, conduite par Otto Hahn, pr\u00e9sident de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Max Planck, a visit\u00e9 l'Institut Weizmann en 1959.\n\n\" Les Isra\u00e9liens sont ceux avec qui il faut travailler parce qu'ils collaborent et \u00e9changent des id\u00e9es. Ils \u00e9changent \u00e9galement des postdocs et des doctorants. Cet \u00e9change doit se poursuivre. Nous ne voulons pas assister \u00e0 une fuite des cerveaux isra\u00e9liens (...) mais les scientifiques ont besoin du meilleur environnement pour leur travail et d'une libert\u00e9 totale \", a-t-il d\u00e9clar\u00e9.\n\nCramer a exprim\u00e9 l'espoir que la coalition et l'opposition isra\u00e9liennes parviennent \u00e0 un compromis sur la r\u00e9forme du syst\u00e8me judiciaire et ne s'est pas aventur\u00e9 \u00e0 dire ce qu'il pourrait advenir des liens scientifiques germano-isra\u00e9liens si le gouvernement poursuivait ses projets de refonte.\n\nEn attendant, les doctorants et les post-doctorants continueront \u00e0 participer \u00e0 des programmes d'\u00e9change, tout le monde attendant avec impatience de voir comment les choses \u00e9volueront.\n\n\" Les deux parties souhaitent vivement que nous puissions continuer \u00e0 collaborer au plus haut niveau, comme nous l'avons fait par le pass\u00e9 \", a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 Cramer.",

        "title": "TRAI releases Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Repealing Regulations, 2023",
        "body": "Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) issued Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Repealing Regulations, 2023 (02 of 2023) dated July 25, 2023 to repeal the Regulation on quality of service of dial-up and leased line internet access service, 2001 (4 of 2001) with effect from date of its notification in Official Gazette.\n\nThe TRAI notified the Regulation on quality of service of dial-up and leased line internet access service, 2001 (4 of 2001) on December 10, 2001. This regulation was applicable to all the Basic Service Operators and Internet Service Providers, including the incumbent operators viz. BSNL, MTNL and VSNL. The purpose of laying down Quality of Service Parameters was to ensure customer satisfaction by laying down norms of network performance, which the service provider is required to achieve by proper dimensioning of his network; measure the Quality of Service from time to time and to compare that with the specified norms so as to monitor the level of performance, provided by various service providers and to protect the interests of subscribers of the Internet services.\n\nThese regulations were issued when the dial up service was the only service available for accessing low speed internet. With the passage of time, the telecommunication networks, both wireline as well as wireless, have evolved to offer high speed broadband service on xDSL, FTTH, LTE and 5G etc, technologies. Whereas the leased line access services are generally offered by Internet Gateway Service Providers (IGSPs) holding an ISP licence to enterprises, is a Service Level Agreement (SLA) based service. Being SLA based service, the agreement among the contracting parties has sufficient provisions to safeguard concerns regarding service quality. Hence, the regulation on quality of service of dial-up and leased line internet access service, 2001, appears to be no more relevant in the present context.\n\nIn view of the above, earlier the Authority issued draft Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Repealing Regulations, 2023 on April 03, 2023 inviting comments of the stakeholders up to April 17, 2023. Based on the comments of the stakeholders and considering the aspect of Ease of Doing Business (EoDB), the Authority has decided to repeal the Regulation on quality of service of dial-up and leased line internet access service, 2001 (4 of 2001) with effect from date of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Repealing Regulations, 2023 (02 of 2023) in Official Gazette.",

        "body": "\"Stiamo lavorando sugli obblighi deontologici del web perch\u00e9 se il nostro dipartimento sostiene l'informazione lo fa in un'ottica di responsabilit\u00e0 reciproca: il finanziamento pubblico deve servire nel mondo digitale per migliorare le norme e i comportamenti virtuosi affinch\u00e9 possano aumentare la reputazione dell'informazione e non farla decrescere\". Lo ha annunciato il sottosegretario alla Presidenza del Consiglio con delega all'Informazione e all'Editoria, Alberto Barachini, in occasione della presentazione al Senato del terzo rapporto Ital Communications-Censis dal titolo \"Disinformazione e fake news in Italia. Il sistema dell'informazione alla prova dell'Intelligenza Artificiale\". Rapporto che disegna un panorama sempre pi\u00f9 conflittuale nel mondo dell'informazione italiana. Stando al rapporto il 76,5% degli italiani ritiene che le fake news siano sempre pi\u00f9 sofisticate e difficili da scoprire, il 20,2% crede di non avere le competenze per riconoscerle e il 61,1% di averle solo in parte.\n\nStando al rapporto cresce la consapevolezza degli effetti devastanti della disinformazione, che pu\u00f2 essere arginata da professionisti della comunicazione - si legge nel documento - accreditati come fonti autorevoli e garanti dell'affidabilit\u00e0 e della qualit\u00e0 delle notizie. Di fronte alle insidie che possono venire dal web e dall'utilizzo dell'Intelligenza artificiale, per distinguere la buona dalla cattiva informazione servono competenze solide sulle nuove tecnologie e regolazioni pi\u00f9 stringenti.\n\nSecondo il rapporto cresce il bisogno di informazione, soprattutto online. Oggi circa 47 milioni di italiani, il 93,3% del totale, si informa abitualmente su almeno una delle fonti disponibili, l'83,5% sul web e il 74,1% sui media tradizionali. Sul versante opposto, sono circa 3 milioni e 300mila (il 6,7% del totale) gli individui che hanno rinunciato ad avere un'informazione puntuale su ci\u00f2 che accade, mentre 700.000 italiani non si informano affatto.\n\nIl 64,3% degli italiani utilizza un mix di fonti informative, tradizionali e online, il 9,9% si affida solo ai media tradizionali e il 19,2% (circa 10 milioni di italiani in valore assoluto) alle fonti online. Social media, blog, forum, messaggistica istantanea sono espansioni del nostro io e del modo di vedere il mondo: \u00e8 il fenomeno delle echo chambers, cui sono esposti tutti quelli che frequentano il web e soprattutto i pi\u00f9 giovani, tra i quali il 69,1% utilizza la messaggistica istantanea e il 76,6% i social media per informarsi. Il 56,7% degli italiani \u00e8 convinto che, di fronte al disordine informativo che caratterizza il panorama attuale dell'informazione, sia legittimo rivolgersi alle fonti informali di cui ci si fida di pi\u00f9.\n\nAumentano paure e timori di non essere in grado di riconoscere disinformazione e fake news. Il 76,5% degli italiani ritiene che le fake news siano sempre pi\u00f9 sofisticate e difficili da scoprire, il 20,2% crede di non avere le competenze per riconoscerle e il 61,1% di averle solo in parte. Ma ci sono anche i negazionisti: il 29,7% della popolazione nega l'esistenza delle bufale e pensa che non si debba parlare di fake news, ma di notizie vere che vengono deliberatamente censurate dai palinsesti ufficiali che poi le fanno passare come false. Il riscaldamento globale \u00e8 un argomento di cui si parla tanto e in modo confuso, alimentando cattiva informazione, catastrofismo e persino negazionismo.\n\nIl 34,7% degli italiani \u00e8 convinto che ci sia un allarmismo eccessivo sul cambiamento climatico e il 25,5% ritiene che l'alluvione di quest'anno sia la risposta pi\u00f9 efficace a chi sostiene che si sta progressivamente andando verso la desertificazione. I negazionisti, che sono convinti che il cambiamento climatico non esista, sono il 16,2% della popolazione. Gli individui pi\u00f9 fragili, vale a dire i pi\u00f9 anziani e i meno scolarizzati, sono quelli che appaiono pi\u00f9 confusi e meno in grado di comprendere il problema nella sua complessit\u00e0.",

They then tried jamming the system by making more than ordinary requests to the system. However, no data has been accessed or lost,\" said Owalo.\n\nHe also added that the government was prepared for such an attack and therefore it had put in place measures to address it and continue to improve its cyber security.\n\n\"We cannot stop digitizing our services because of hackers. What we did because we had foreseen this, is to establish and operationalize the office of the data commissioner and anchored it on law to ensure they execute the mandate of data privacy on one hand and data security on the other,\" he said.\n\n\"We are not just coming up with instant remedial solutions to address the current attack but we are ensuring that around this digitalization space, we will build an elaborate risk mitigation framework for purposes of sustainable digitalization,\" he added.\n\nThe issue with the system started a few days ago when Kenyans tried to access services in the platform but were unable to due to.\n\nSome are still experiencing a challenge in logging into the system while others have the issue settled on their end.",

        "title": "How to bridge data silos and enable cloud-like efficiency",
        "body": "Sponsored Feature Modern business decisions rely on intelligent data rather than assumptions. To make informed operational and business choices, organizations amass and store vast amounts of data.\n\nData-driven insights can significantly benefit supply chain management, resource allocation, process optimization, and understanding customer preferences. Personalized business experiences are now expected by 71 percent of consumers, and leveraging valuable data insights can meet this demand. Studies indicate that enhancing the customer experience can boost sales revenues by 2-7 percent and profitability by 1-2 percent.\n\nHowever, businesses struggle to unify data into a single source of truth. Many organizations face challenges in establishing innovative, data-driven processes.\n\nA recent Statista survey of 116 businesses worldwide reveals that many firms still struggle to establish innovative, data-driven organizations. This becomes problematic as digital transformations proceed without sufficient data intelligence. Data silos, inadequate infrastructure to handle growing data volumes, and unstructured data impede the unlocking of data's full potential.\n\nThe exponential growth of data, estimated to be twice as large by 2025, further compounds the issue. Merely collecting and storing data is insufficient; the real challenge lies in extracting meaningful insights for strategic decision-making.\n\nCommon hurdles in unlocking data value and intelligence include:\n\n- Multiple data silos: Silos obstruct data availability and value, necessitating their dismantling to facilitate data access, security, sharing, and collaboration.\n\n- Inadequate infrastructure for high data volumes: Existing on-premises infrastructure may lack the processing power and storage capacity required. Moving resources to the cloud is an option, but it can be costly and complex. Hybrid solutions have gained popularity.\n\n- Unstructured data: Scattered across various locations and formats, unstructured data is difficult to integrate, organize, analyze, and gain insights from.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a robust data management solution that aggregates data from silos, offers valuable insights regardless of storage location, and automates processes using AI. Let's explore how Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) GreenLake provides such a solution.\n\nWave goodbye to data silos\n\nHPE GreenLake, an edge-to-cloud platform, enables data-first modernization through various services. By integrating existing infrastructures with cloud resources, organizations can adopt a cloud-like experience without full migration. The platform allows businesses to maximize their edge investments while capitalizing on cloud scalability, agility, and innovation.\n\nThe platform also analyzes data wherever it resides, to address cost and complexity concerns associated with sending, storing, and analyzing data in the cloud. It eliminates data silos and empowers organizations to extract real-time insights from their operations, delivering a holistic view of their data-driven insights.\n\nWith this approach, companies can also apply the same data management policies, rules and deployments across their on-premise and cloud environments with minimal overhead.\n\nOffered on a self-service, pay-as-you-go model, HPE GreenLake provides businesses with control over accessing and consuming services. The automated self-service functionality enables provisioning, configuration, and management of IT resources according to specific requirements.\n\nThe pay-as-you-go model eliminates upfront capital expenditures, allowing businesses to scale resources based on demand and align IT spending with operational needs.\n\nHPE GreenLake gives customers the opportunity to get a true picture of activities across their hybrid estate by offering an analytics dashboard that can display key features, such as consumption analytics, continuous regulatory compliance monitoring, and fast provisioning.\n\n\"Businesses now have the opportunity to use the HPE GreenLake Cloud Portal (GLCP), which is designed to harmonize all the assets owned by a company into a single pane, which can be fed over time into an analytics backend, allowing businesses to have an overview of how their data is performing,\" says Williams.\n\nSeveral case studies highlight how HPE GreenLake adoption has helped companies sustain business growth through data intelligence.\n\nIn summary, data is a valuable resource, but its true worth lies in the insights it provides. HPE GreenLake aims to bridge data silos and enable cloud-like efficiency within on-premises infrastructure. By maintaining control, governance, security, and familiarity, organizations can achieve data-first business transformation.",

The new security-oriented feature simply surfaces existing tools on WhatsApp to make it easier for users to deal with unwanted contact on the Meta-owned messaging service. These features have been rolled out to some users who have signed up to receive beta versions of WhatsApp for Android and are likely to roll out to all users at a later date.\n\nAs part of the latest WhatsApp beta for Android 2.23.16.6 update, the messaging platform has rolled out support for a new Safety tools section that shows up when an unknown person -- or business account -- messages you for the first time. The new card, spotted on the beta release by WhatsApp feature tracker WABetaInfo, also informs you about how profile photos work on the service and how to check the phone number of the sender.\n\nScreenshots of both features shared by the feature tracker\n\nPhoto Credit: WABetaInfo\n\nAccording to a screenshot shared by WABetaInfo, the messaging app will display a card with two options that allow you to block or report an unknown sender when they message you for the first time. These are options that already exist on the platform -- WhatsApp has offered blocking and reporting for years. However, making them more easily accessible could help users deal with unwanted spam with a couple of taps.\n\nThe new safety tools tab will also inform you that profile photos and users are set by users on WhatsApp and not verified by the platform. This is presumably to warn users to be careful when texting unknown users and to protect themselves from scams that are popular on messaging apps. WhatsApp also asks users to check the country code while responding to messages from known senders.\n\nMeanwhile, WABetaInfo reports that the recently released WhatsApp beta for Android 2.23.16.3 update adds a feature that could make it easy for you to share details with a group of contacts on the platform. After updating to the beta version, you should see an option to create a new group at the top right corner of the screen, when you are forwarding a message on WhatsApp.\n\nThe shortcut to create a group while forwarding a message is likely to make it easier to share content on WhatsApp. On the stable version of WhatsApp, you'll need to create a group first, then go to to the message you want to forward and select the newly created group.\n\nIt is worth noting that both these new features are currently in beta testing and there is no word on when they will be released to all users on the stable channel. WhatsApp is yet to roll out these features to testers on iOS -- which suggests that it could be a few weeks before they are available for all users on iOS and Android.",

        "title": "Google Unveils Multimodal Generative AI Model Med-PaLM M for Healthcare",
        "body": "Clinicians express preference for Med-PaLM M reports on chest X-rays over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of cases\n\nGoogle Health, Google Deepmind and Google AI have unveiled Med-PaLM M, a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodes and interprets biomedical data. It can handle various types of medical data, including clinical language, medical images, and genomics, and performs well on a wide range of tasks, all using the same set of model weights.\n\nIt was built by fine tuning and aligning PaLM-E, a language model from Google AI, to the medical field using a specially curated open-source benchmark called MultiMedBench. MultiMedBench consists of 7 biomedical data types and 14 diverse tasks, such as medical question-answering, generating radiology reports, and identifying genomic variations. With over 1 million samples, this benchmark encourages the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.\n\nMed-PaLM M excels in all tasks on MultiMedBench, often outperforming specialist models by a significant margin and even surpassing PaLM-E, proving the importance of adapting the model to biomedical data.\n\nThe key idea behind building a large-scale biomedical AI is to use language as a common framework for different tasks. This allows the AI to combine knowledge from various sources and transfer skills across tasks more effectively.\n\nExcitingly, preliminary evidence suggests that Med-PaLM M can generalise to new medical tasks and concepts and perform multimodal reasoning without specific training. It can accurately identify and describe medical conditions in images using only language-based instructions and prompts, even if it has never seen such cases before.\n\nTo assess the practical use of Med-PaLM M in clinical settings, radiologists evaluated AI-generated reports at different scales. The AI's error rate was found to be comparable to that of radiologists from previous studies, indicating its potential clinical usefulness. The big tech launched the first version of MedPaLM in December, 2022.\n\nRead more: Responsible AI Takes Center Stage at Google I/O Connect\n\nGoogle's Unwavering Commitment to AI in Healthcare\n\nGoogle's Med-PaLM 2, a medical chatbot that answers medical questions, has been a fan favourite since its launch.\n\nMed-PaLM 2 is built upon Google's language model, PaLM 2, and uses LLMs tailored to the medical domain. The AI has demonstrated impressive performance on medical question-answering datasets, achieving high accuracy on the US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)-style questions and the Indian AIIMS and NEET medical examination questions.\n\nGoogle acknowledges the complexity of personalised medical care and recognises that Med-PaLM 2's results may not be generalisable to every medical question-answering setting and audience. The AI is trained on medical Q/A datasets but excludes patients' personal data to adhere to ethical norms.\n\nWhile having access to patients' personal data could enhance Med-PaLM 2's efficiency, privacy concerns are likely to prevent many patients from sharing such information. Google ensures that customers testing Med-PaLM 2 will retain control of their data in encrypted settings, inaccessible to the tech company, and the AI program will not ingest any of that data.",

        "body": "In a short video, a doctor narrates the story of a woman who lost her eye. He emphasised the reasons why one should never use contact lenses.\n\nDo you choose contact lenses over glasses? Then this TikTok doctor's revelation might make you question your decision. In his short video online segment titled 'New Fear Unlocked', the man named GP Samuel detailed why you must never rely on contact lenses. According to LadBible, in the TikTok clip, he shared the story of the woman who had to get her eye removed owing to a severe infection. Hailing from Leicestershire, Marie Mason quickly developed a strange problem after wearing contact lenses. The doctor claimed she would often shower keeping her lenses on which became the root cause of the infection.\n\nUpon inspection by an eye specialist, the woman was diagnosed with a severe contact lens-related infection. \"They found that this was caused by a parasite that can be found in tap water that can go underneath your contact lens when you shower. That parasite is called acanthamoeba,\" he reportedly said. GP Samuel emphasized the problem wasn't caused by a virus or bacteria, which meant that a typical antibiotic drop did not work effectively against it. Notably, the woman suffered for five years during which she underwent three corneal transplants but nothing came to fruition.\n\nEventually, she had to opt for a complete eye removal to get rid of the infection. The TikTok doctor suggested the chances of contracting acanthamoeba are extremely rare. The possibility is said to be one in 5000 people but he warned when the infection becomes severe it can lead to vision loss. In the segment, the doctor also ended up highlighting prevention techniques to minimize the risk of infection while wearing lenses. He strictly cautioned against sleeping, swimming, or showing up without removing them. \"Always wash your hands before handling contact lenses, only use approved solutions, and change your lens case regularly,\" he continued.\n\nIn another segment titled '10 things I will never do ever since I became a doctor', GP Samuel said he will never choose to wear contact lenses. He believes most people do not know the severity of contact lens- an infection that can deprive an individual of maintaining normal vision.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Marie Mason first began experiencing discomfort in her eye in 2015. She underwent three corneal procedures to treat the damage leading up to her eye removal in March 2020. She reportedly wears a false replacement ever since the surgery.",

We are also trying to preserve their mental and physical health.\n\n\"It is quite important that the career is also being cared for because most times we look at health workers as just people who care for other people, but we have come to realize that doctors, nurses and other health workers are just as vulnerable as other members of the society\". He said.\n\nWhile officially launching the Y2023 State Continuing Medical Education programme, Ogboye stated that the State Government remains committed and determined to ensuring best practises in health care delivery and will continue to insist that the environment in which medical care is provided should be conducive to the promotion and maintenance of good health.\n\nProfessor Akin Osibogun, who delivered a lecture titled \"Leading and Influencing Positive Changes in the Health Sector,\" explained that good leadership in the health sector must be in tune with technological skills, high-quality managerial skills, and social skills in order to communicate and interact with stakeholders at all levels.\n\nHe stated that health-care leaders must always consider the next generation of leaders and must ensure that they train and develop the potential of their younger colleagues for critical leadership roles in order to have a good succession plan in health-care service delivery.\n\n\"A good leader in the health sector must be equipped with technological skills in the field, managerial skills that will enable him to plan, implement and evaluate programmes by following management processes and social skills to be able to communicate and interact with stakeholders at all levels\". He said.\n\nProfessor Osibogun encouraged all health care workers to move towards achieving a positive changes in health care service delivery as a positive change in health care delivery will enhance a sustainable health care delivery that will be of a great benefit to the citizenry\n\nEarlier, the Director, Medical Administration, Training and Programs, Dr. Olufunmilayo Shokunbi explained that the CME programme is a capacity building strategy of the Government targeted at addressing the health needs of caregivers so that they can discharge their duties optimally.\n\nShe noted that the Lagos State Government recognizes the importance of having a smart workforce, and that is why the CME programme would be addressing carefully selected topics that will add value to health workers.\n\nShokunbi urged health workers in Lagos State to continue to avail themselves with necessary knowledge that will ultimately enhance their service delivery and wellbeing.\n\nOne of the participants at the programme, Dr. Tolu Ajomale, commended the Lagos State Government for being consistent in organizing the yearly CME programme and other strategic workshop for health worker.\n\nHe said that the training programme will avail participants the opportunity to learn, unlearn and relearn.

        "body": "To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com.\n\nOn 19 July 2023, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a draft Reflection paper on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the lifecycle of medicines (the Paper). The Paper recognises the value of this technology as part of the digital transformation within healthcare, and acknowledges its increasing use and potential to \"support the acquisition, transformation, analysis, and interpretation of data within the medicinal product lifecycle\", provided of course it is \"used correctly\".\n\nThe Paper reflects EMA's early experience with and considerations on the use of AI, and gives a sense of how EMA expects applicants and holders of marketing authorisations to use AI and machine learning (ML) tools. The EMA has made clear that the use of AI should comply with existing rules on data requirements as applicable to the particular function that the AI is undertaking. It is clear that any data generated by AI/ML will be closely scrutinised by the EMA, and a risk-based approach should be taken depending on the AI functionality and the use for which the data is generated.\n\nThe Paper is open for consultation until 31 December 2023. EMA also plans to hold a workshop on 20-21 November 2023 to further discuss the draft Paper. EMA's plan is to use the feedback from the public consultation to finalise the Paper and produce future detailed guidance. Our summary below sets out the key takeaways and the key issues that arise in the Paper.\n\nUse of AI by physicians to support clinical decisions and imaging analysis is increasingly common. EMA's Paper represents, however, a deeper dive and covers every step in the medicines' lifecycle and identifies the areas which fall within EMA's or national authorities' remit. From drug discovery to pharmacovigilance, marketing authorisation applicants and holders will need to have in place mechanisms that ensure that AI and ML are transparent, accessible, validated and monitored. EMA highlights that it is their responsibility to ensure that \"all algorithms, models, datasets, and data processing pipelines used are fit for purpose and are in line with ethical, technical, scientific, and regulatory standards as described in GxP standards and current EMA scientific guidelines\".\n\nThe Paper covers the following stages in the medicines lifecycle:\n\nWhere AI/ML use is expected to impact the benefit-risk, even potentially, of the medicinal product, developers are advised to interact with the regulators as early as possible (i.e., through scientific advice or qualification of innovative development methods). The greater the potential regulatory impact or risk, the greater the scrutiny by the relevant competent authorities. This means that marketing authorisation applicants/holders will have to consider all the stages where AI/ML systems have been used and assess what is the effect on the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product.\n\nTaking as an example the use of AI/ML tools to select participants to clinical trials or analyse the data obtained during the trials: while it is the responsibility of the sponsor of the clinical trial to ensure, for example, that the use of AI/ML systems comply with statistical principles for clinical trials, ethical rules, or technical aspects, it is for the marketing authorisation applicant to \"convince\" EMA or the national authorities that data obtained through the use of AI/ML is trustworthy, reliable and robust. If the applicant does not have a good understanding of the related processes or functioning of the AI/ML model, there is a risk that the applicant will not be able to appropriately support its application for a marketing authorisation.\n\nThe Paper covers the technical parameters that need to be taken into consideration when using AI/ML systems throughout the stages of the medicinal product lifecycle. These involve in particular:\n\nAI/ML systems may qualify as medical devices regulated under the EU Medical Devices Regulations. While the qualification and classification of such systems is defined by the medical devices legislation, EMA will assess AI/ML medical devices used in clinical trials and that generate data to support marketing authorisation applications for medicinal products. In particular, EMA will consider whether use of the AI/ML can generate robust data to support the marketing authorisation application, and the regulatory status of the AI/ML will be considered by other relevant authorities.\n\nIn parallel, it is worth highlighting that the AI/ML systems will also be subject to the EU AI Act, once adopted. See our recent advisory for a summary of the current status of the Act.\n\nMarketing authorisation applicants and holders are advised to comply with the ethical principles provided in the guidelines for trustworthy AI and presented in Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence for self-assessment (ALTAI). EMA also provides that an impact analysis should be systematically conducted at an early stage.\n\nIn addition, collection and processing of personal data must take place in accordance with the applicable legislation on data protection. The Paper recommends the use of risk assessments focused on AI.\n\nEMA highlights that many recommendations and best practices also apply to the field of AI/ML and provides a useful list of relevant guidance at the end of the Paper.",

        "body": "A quarter of smokers believe the money they could save from quitting the habit would be \"life changing\" - and a third feel guilty about the amount they spend on cigarettes. The research of 1,500 smokers revealed 32 per cent predict they'll be paying \u00a31 or more per cigarette before the end of 2024 - but 26 per cent reckon they will be forced to try and quit if the \u00a31 threshold is crossed, due to the cost.\n\nPerhaps counter-intuitively, a quarter of smokers regard the idea of a \u00a31 cigarette to be a bigger psychological trigger to push them to quit, than the idea of paying \u00a320 for a pack of 20. The findings are part of the \"IQOS No Smoke Index\", an ongoing research project designed to better understand the challenges faced by UK smokers attempting to quit cigarettes.\n\nHarry Wake, from IQOS - a tobacco heating system that, unlike cigarettes, produce no fire, ash, or smoke - said: \"The cost of cigarettes is clearly a huge factor for many smokers seeking cheaper and less harmful alternatives.\n\n\"The research shows there's definitely a psychological trigger in paying more than a pound for a single cigarette, and it looks as though rising costs will naturally push people to the limits of what they can afford to pay for a habit - it is getting to the point of not being sustainable.\"\n\nThe research also revealed 24 per cent believe price is a big factor in whether they continue to smoke, while 16 per cent admit that their family would notice the financial benefit if they stopped smoking cigarettes. Other triggers to try and quit, according to the index, conducted via OnePoll, would be if a child or grandchild asked them to - or if a partner pleaded with them to do so.\n\nMore than four in ten (41 per cent) have already attempted a switch to vaping to try and cut smoking, while 32 per cent have tried nicotine patches, and 27 per cent have turned to gums or lozenges. However, 39 per cent of smokers admitted to using no aids or methods during their last quit attempt, instead choosing to go \"cold turkey\" - but only nine per cent managed to stay off the habit for longer than a month.\n\nHarry Wake, from IQOS, added: \"While everyone knows the best choice any smoker can make is to quit tobacco and nicotine products completely, for those that don't, switching completely presents less risk to your health than continuing to smoke. \"Of course, it's easier said than done when it comes to stopping smoking, but the benefits are there for all to see - health and wealth, it's a win-win all round.\"",

        "body": "Sinead O'Connor saw herself as a protest singer, rather than a pop star and used her fame as a force for good to make the world a better place\n\nSinead O'Connor used her fame to \"break down stigmas\" after insisting she was not a pop star, but a \"protest singer\".\n\nThe star sadly died on Thursday at the age of 56, just 18 months after her 17-year-old son Shane took his own life.\n\nThroughout her career she always challenged norms, from her trademark shaved head which became her signature look, to championing causes close to her heart and often sharing controversial views.\n\nOne of her biggest punk rock moments was when she tore up a picture of Pope John Paul II on US TV show Saturday Night Live in 1992 in protest at the Catholic Church child abuse scandal.\n\nAbused herself as a child and sent to one of Ireland's notorious Magdalene Laundries when she was 14, her act of defiance got her banned from SNL for life and a backlash followed.\n\nSinead kept her hair short throughout her life to avoid abuse from men ( Image: VEVO/YouTube/Avalon)\n\nDespite never having another hit in America after her song Nothing Compares 2 U came out, Sinead refused to bite her tongue.\n\nIn her memoir, Rememberings, she says: \"The media was making me out to be crazy because I wasn't acting like a pop star is supposed to act. I feel that having a No.1 record derailed my career and my tearing up the [Pope] photo put me back on the right track.\"\n\nBy the time Sinead appeared on Saturday Night Live she had already been branded \"crazy\" for boycotting the 1991 Grammy Awards when her album I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got was named best alternative music performance.\n\nIn a letter to the academy, she said the awards \"acknowledge mostly the commercial side of art\", but that she believed an artist's purpose was to \"inspire and, in some way, guide and heal the human race, of which we are all equal members\".\n\nShe had no regrets about tearing the then Pope's photo up, saying: \"I'm not sorry I did it. It was brilliant. But it was very traumatising. It was open season on treating me like a crazy b***h.\"\n\nTearing up the Pope's photo in protest at abuse in the Catholic Church on SNL ( Image: Yvonne Hemsey/Getty Images)\n\nA group called the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations hired a steamroller to crush hundreds of her albums outside her company's headquarters, actor Joe Pesci threatened to smack her in an SNL monologue and Frank Sinatra called her \"one stupid broad\".\n\nIn another act of defiance, Sinead became ordained as a priest and announced she wanted to be known as Mother Bernadette Mary.\n\nShe went on to convert to Islam in 2018 and adopted the name Shuhada' Davitt, later Shuhada Sadaqat -- although she continued to use Sinead O'Connor professionally.\n\nBut whatever life threw at her, Sinead continued to be herself and often spoke out on abuse that was happening in her native Ireland and elsewhere, particularly to women.\n\nWomen's Aid Ireland, which works to prevent and help victims of domestic abuse, said she helped change the country for the better calling her a \"fearless voice and courageous light\".\n\nSinead was ordained a priest in 1991 and adopted the name Mother Bernadette Mary ( Image: PA)\n\n\"You truly challenged Ireland, and a world, that stifled women, children and anyone who didn't conform,\" the organisation tweeted. \"Your power, your anger, your pain and fragility gave strength to many survivors to speak out.\"\n\nSinead was also a supporter of people living with HIV and AIDS and famously wore a T-shirt supporting what was then the Dublin AIDS Alliance on The Late, Late Show in 1990.\n\nSpeaking about what a difference it made, writer and AIDS survivor Jason Reid said: \"Sinead O'Connor cared. In Ireland, Sinead publicly supported people with HIV/AIDS when many denigrated us.\n\n\"She used her fame to help break down stigma and bring about change. We were lucky to have Sinead.\"\n\nWhen it came to her hair, some might have believed her shaved head was a trademark fashion statement, but Sinead revealed the real reason she preferred the cropped style.\n\nIn an emotional interview with TV psychologist Dr Phil, she said she remained bald because she didn't want to be viewed as 'pretty'. And she feared that if she was seen in that light, that she could be subjected to danger at the hands of men.\n\nShe shared: \"It was dangerous to be pretty because I was getting raped and molested everywhere I went. That was a huge part of it.\"\n\n* If you've been the victim of sexual assault, you can access help and resources via www.rapecrisis.org.uk or calling the national telephone helpline on 0808 802 9999\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads",

        "title": "Does Fiber Help You Lose Weight? How Does It Work 2023?",
        "body": "Does Fiber Help You Lose Weight? Dietary fiber has a role in managing several diseases shown in different clinical studies. We need high-fiber foods for our metabolism, digestive system, and gut health and to prevent related chronic diseases such as obesity.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration defines dietary fiber as all carbohydrates that are neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine. Dietary fiber effects depend on chemical characteristics such as solubility, viscosity, and fermentability which determine the fiber functions in the body.\n\nThese functions can be related to digestive functions, micronutrient availability, gut transit time, stool formation, and microbiota profile. Altogether, these effects benefit different chronic diseases.\n\nSo how much fiber do you need? Researchers and specialists recommended a daily intake for adults of 25-35 grams of fiber per day. However, the average daily dietary fiber intake remains lower than 20 grams per day in adults worldwide.\n\nHigh fiber intake in the dietis important for both weight loss and overall health benefits, and you can get fiber only from plant-based foods. Here is a high-fiber foods list with their fiber amounts per portion.\n\nThe fiber characteristics affect sugar and fat absorption, stool structure, and frequency. These functions help regulate the digestive system.\n\nSolubility is the ability of dietary fibers to dissolve in water. Insoluble fibers remain as discrete particles in water. Soluble dietary fibers thicken when they cross with water and have a role in the digestive tract concentration-dependent manner.\n\nDietary fiber intake also changes microbiota composition, stimulating the production of secondary metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids that are an important nutrient for beneficial bacteria in the intestine.\n\nIt is easier to access and metabolize soluble dietary fiber for fiber-degrading microorganisms in the intestine than with insoluble dietary fiber. Soluble fibers help to produce beneficial and functional metabolites.\n\nHere are the soluble and insoluble dietary fiber sources:\n\nSome fermentable fibers function as prebiotics. Prebiotic is a term for \"a substrate that is selectively utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit\". Inulin-type fibers and galactooligosaccharides are prebiotic fibers.\n\nPrebiotic fibers have a fermentative capacity and lead to the release of short-chain fatty acids. It is a substrate for stimulating the growth of beneficial bacteria, as we mentioned above. In 2018, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 64 randomized controlled trials demonstrated that fiber, especially fructans, and galactooligosaccharides, increases the Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, beneficial bacteria species, in microbiota.\n\nAs you can see from the research results, fiber will help you lose weight, but how? What are the mechanisms that fiber provides for weight loss?\n\nThe health benefits of fibers are mostly related to the digestive system. Fiber intake can increase the amount of food intake while reducing total energy intake because the energy density of higher-fiber foods is lower than low-fiber foods. Soluble fibers can increase the time in the stomach during digestion and delay or decrease sugar and fat absorption in the intestine.\n\nThis mechanism reduces both the absorption of calories and insulin secretion from the pancreas. Therefore fiber consumption is helpful for weight loss, blood sugar, and insulin control.\n\nDigestive problems, mainly constipation, are major findings of people with high body weight. Therefore, regulating digestive problems and relaxing the bowels helps the management of body weight and increases the quality of life.\n\nFiber intake can decrease gut transit time, which means better constipation management and defecation frequency increment. Research conducted with healthy individuals showed that an increased additional nine grams of wheat bran for three days compared to a low-fiber control diet significantly lowered gut transit time, also called gastric emptying.\n\nWheat bran supplementation increased stool frequency from one per day to 1.5 cups per day. Other studies have shown that supplementation with cellulose-pectin combination, short-chain fructooligosaccharides supplements, and high-fiber breakfast cereals also increase stool frequency. According to these effects, fibers can flatten your abdominal area and help you to lose belly fat.\n\nYou burn calories while you digest food called the thermic effect of food. The meal volume (larger meal size) and the effort you give to digest are related to this calorie expenditure. Therefore, dietary carbohydrate with high fiber increases the thermic effect of foods. Thus, high-fiber, high-protein diets are perfect for increasing energy expenditure.\n\nWhen it comes to appetite control, dietary fibers are our best supporters of us. Because fiber consumption, primarily soluble fibers, helps you hold a large amount of water and increase tension in the stomach wall, which triggers signals from the digestive system to the brain called vagal signals which give feedback to the brain about fullness and satiation. Also, you produce more short-chain fatty acids in the intestine if you consume dietary fibers that can be fermented by bacteria. Short-chain fatty acids also decrease your hunger and control your appetite with the stimulation of the secretion of special peptides in the intestine to suppress appetites, such as cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide-1, peptide YY, etc. These molecules also go to the brain and say you are done with eating.\n\nPeople with high weight generally have impaired blood sugar control, increased blood fat and cholesterol levels, and constipation are common in them. Dietary fibers help you to lose weight by reducing obesity-related outcomes or improving your overall health by eliminating these health problems.\n\nA review of large prospective cohort studies indicated that consumption of more than 28 grams per day for women and 38 grams for men of insoluble cereal fibers or whole-grain products might reduce insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes risk by 20-30%.\n\nWater-soluble viscous-forming dietary fibers help to reduce total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (bad cholesterol) levels by about 5-10%. High-fiber foods, such as oats, barley, legumes, flax seeds, apples, and citrus foods, show cholesterol-lowering benefits.\n\nDietary fibers have a role in the excretion of bile and cholesterol in the stool. It is an essential mechanism for both high blood cholesterol and fatty liver disease.\n\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of seven studies concluded that fiber consumption is an effective treatment for chronic constipation in adults compared with a placebo. These studies showed that dietary fiber such as wheat bran, supplement forms such as psyllium, and prebiotics such as inulin increased stool frequency and normalized stool consistency.\n\nFiberous products contain phytates that reduce the absorption of dietary minerals such as iron, zinc, and calcium. But also, several human studies have shown that specific fibers, such as fructans and galactooligosaccharides, may increase dietary calcium absorption.\n\nIf you have inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's or ulcerative colitis, or irritable bowel syndrome, you should consult your doctor about your dietary fiber intake. Because in such cases, the gut and microbiota may not function normally and may affect how you tolerate dietary fibers. Also, some dietary approaches, such as a lectin-free diet, restrict several high-fiber foods due to other structures these foods contain.\n\nDoes Fiber Help You Lose Weight? Dietary fiber is a potent diet strategy for weight loss, as it is in many ways for health promotion. It helps you control your appetite by transmitting satiety signals from the digestive system to the brain.\n\nIt positively supports bacterial diversity in the microbiota, which is associated with many diseases. In addition, it provides blood sugar and insulin regulation by prolonging the digestion and absorption times while also binding and removing some fat and cholesterol.\n\nAll these are functional mechanisms for weight loss. However, it is beneficial to choose the fiber sources that you consume with your doctor and registered dietitian, considering your health status.",

All the core competencies, fire rescue, hazmat, EMS, rescue, leadership.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nMario Troncoso first attended TEEX Fire Training School in the early 1990s. Now, three decades later, he is back to serve as an adjunct instructor teaching fire service leadership development and strategy in tactics unique to firefighting.\n\n\"Taking all the classes and then realizing that commitment that the instructors have given to come here for free, I wanted to give back,\" said Troncoso, who serves as the fire chief at Cibolo Fire Department. \"That's why I wanted to be an adjunct instructor and come back and gain the knowledge from the other instructors here and of course spread the knowledge that I've gained to other volunteer career firefighters.\"\n\nThe training he has received from TEEX has been formative throughout his time as a firefighter and fire chief, Troncoso said.\n\n\"I can honestly say, it's been very, very tremendous to my career,\" he said. \"Gaining the basics as a firefighter, coming into my leadership development, I went through the Fire Service Chief Executive Officer Program that they have here as well. That helped me in my current position as the fire chief.\"\n\nThis year, Texas A&M Forest Services (TAMFS) provided $459,988 in grants to over 626 firefighters across 190 departments through the Rural Volunteer Fire Department Assistance Program, a cost-sharing program funded by the Texas Legislature. Through these grants, TAMFS covers tuition, food and lodging for nearly 50% of the state's county volunteer firefighters to attend TEEX's annual training. The funding also provides firefighting vehicles, equipment and clothing to volunteer fire departments.\n\nWorters said without these grants, her department wouldn't have been able to attend this year's training.\n\n\"Some of the trainings that they have are just wonderful,\" she said. Last year, I did the confined space [training], and it was the whole week, you're just amped up. The training is fantastic. It sets you up really well for any rescue scenarios. The instructors are really wonderful.\"\n\nIn an effort to conserve, all water used in training is cleaned and reused on sight. Recent studies which found evidence of PFAS in firefighting foam is not a concern for TEEX as the organization does not use fluorinated compounds in its firefighting foam, Lohmeyer said.\n\n\"We actually have a closure with the state of Texas to ensure that our systems are clean,\" he said. \"I don't want to say we're exempt from that but, we don't use fluorinated compounds.\"\n\nThe annual training included firefighting demonstrations open to the public Wednesday night at Brayton Fire Training Field. The demonstration consisted of explanations for techniques used to fight fires on several large, live-fire training props.\n\nTags Education Job Market Security And Public Safety School Systems Business Politics The Economy Social Services Welfare Business And Commercial Law Sociology Get local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

Photograph: ANI Photo\n\n\"I could not say anything after that and it was the last time I heard from him,\" Kanta Devi told PTI as she broke down into tears.\n\nSingh, a native of Jammu, was commissioned into 18 Grenadiers at the age of 18. During the Kargil war, 18 Grenadiers were tasked with recapturing the Tiger Hill with two other battalions.\n\nThe battalion launched an attack and came under intense fire from the enemy after reaching the hill top. Singh died in the gun battle and was awarded a Sena Medal posthumously.\n\nKanta Devi, who was visiting the Lamochen View Point here to attend an event to commemorate the 24th Kargil Vijay Diwas, said she has preserved her son's bullet-riddled wallet.\n\n\"It has bloodstains on it and contains some crumpled currency notes. When I die, I want it to be consigned to the flames with me. There is no bigger pain for a mother than to see her son die. He was supposed to be the one to light my funeral pyre,\" said an inconsolable Kanta Devi.\n\n\"But his words and dedication towards the nation make me proud,\" she said.\n\nDuring his year-long service, whenever Singh visited home, his family would distribute sweets in their neighbourhood.\n\n\"Somehow, I always felt that I needed to celebrate his return. A mother's heart just knows. When he went back the last time, I knew he wasn't coming back,\" Kanta Devi said.\n\nThe Indian Army had launched a fierce counterassault, Operation Vijay, to push back Pakistani forces that had stealthily occupied important heights in Ladakh in 1999.\n\nThe Kargil War saw Indian soldiers fight in the most challenging terrain under harsh weather conditions leading to the defeat of the enemy in Drass, Kargil and Batalik sectors.\n\nKargil Vijay Diwas is observed on July 26 every year to mark India's victory over Pakistan.",

        "body": "A new study by researchers who have developed a diet score that encompasses both ecological and health-related factors.\n\nEating more planet-friendly foods could help reduce the risk of death from cancer, heart disease, respiratory illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases, according to a new study by researchers who have developed a diet score that encompasses both ecological and health-related factors. Wholegrain cereals, fruit, vegetables, nuts and unsaturated oils are just some of the foods that can help reduce the carbon footprint of our diets while improving health, according to a new study. Drawing on scientific literature on the subject, the authors of this research have established a new diet score called the \"Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI)\", which is based on both planet-friendly foods and those that promote better health.\n\nThe aim is to create a simple tool, \"that policymakers and public health practitioners could use to develop strategies to improve public health and address the climate crisis,\" explains a news release for the study. \"A sustainable dietary pattern should not only be healthy but also consistent within planetary boundaries for greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental parameters,\" says researcher Linh Bui, MD, a PhD candidate in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nAlso read: Chennai Street Food Vendor Makes Colourful 'Panda Dosa' And It is Too Cute to Eat\n\nThe study was based on the EAT-Lancet reference diet, which takes into account the environmental impact of food production practices. Results obtained from over 100,000 people who participated in two large cohort studies conducted in the United States were also taken into account. According to the research led by Linh Bui, people who followed a more environmentally-friendly diet were 25% less likely to die over a follow-up period of more than 30 years, compared with those who regularly ate less environmentally-friendly foods such as eggs or red meat.\n\nIn detail, they found that higher PHDI scores were associated with a 15% lower risk of death from cancer or cardiovascular disease. The benefits were even greater for neurodegenerative and respiratory diseases, with a reduction in the risk of death estimated at 20% and 50% respectively.\n\nThe study findings were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, held from July 22 to 25 in Boston. Linh Bui points out, however, that the PHDI index does not necessarily reflect all food products and their relationships with all major diseases in all countries. \"People with specific health conditions, religious restrictions, or different food accessibility due to socioeconomic status or food availability may face challenges with adhering to a more sustainable diet pattern. Further research could help to elucidate and address such barriers,\" the study news release explains.",

        "title": "Heiz\u00f6lpreise Stadt Pforzheim aktuell: Alles zur Preisentwicklung und zum \u00d6lverbrauch in Ihrer N\u00e4he",
        "body": "Wie sich die Preise f\u00fcr Heiz\u00f6l in Ihrer N\u00e4he t\u00e4glich entwickeln, wie viel Heiz\u00f6l in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg verbraucht wird, und worauf Sie bei der Heiz\u00f6lbestellung achten m\u00fcssen, lesen Sie hier auf news.de.\n\nHeiz\u00f6lpreise, Lieferzeiten und Prognosen zur Preisentwicklung schwanken in der Bundesrepublik stetig und unterscheiden sich nicht nur tagesaktuell, sondern auch regional sehr stark. 98,97 Euro zahlen Sie aktuell, am 27.07.2023, in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg durchschnittlich f\u00fcr 100 Liter Heiz\u00f6l. Wie genau steht es in Pforzheim um den Heiz\u00f6l-Preis und welche aktuellen Lieferfristen gibt es?\n\n96,71 Euro bezahlen Sie durchschnittlich heute f\u00fcr 100 Liter in der Stadt Pforzheim. Damit liegt der Preis in Pforzheim unter dem Durchschnitt von Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Beachten Sie, dass sich dieser Wert auf den Kauf von 3000 Litern bezieht. Entsprechend variiert der Preis, wenn Sie eine andere Menge Heiz\u00f6l erwerben.\n\nDie Daten in der folgenden Tabelle zeigen den Durchschnittspreis pro 100 Liter, wobei die Gebiete aller Postleitzahlen aus dem gesamten Stadtkreis zusammengefasst werden (zuletzt aktualisiert am 27.07.2023).\n\nUm die Kaufpreise f\u00fcr Heiz\u00f6l richtig einordnen zu k\u00f6nnen, lohnt sich immer ein Blick auf die Preisentwicklung. Die folgende Tabelle bietet Ihnen einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die Durchschnittspreise in Pforzheim des letzten Monats. Ausgegangen wird hier von einer gekauften Menge von 3000 Litern und angegeben ist der Preis f\u00fcr 100 Liter.\n\nDas Preisniveau von heute ist im Vergleich zum durchschnittlichen Preisniveau des letzten Jahres sehr niedrig. Derzeit funktioniert die Heiz\u00f6lbestellung relativ unproblematisch, wobei die Lieferfrist im Schnitt aktuell sogar geduldige 44 Arbeitstage in Pforzheim umfasst. Die Preisentwicklungen am Markt werden aktuell wieder st\u00e4rker von Verbrauchern beobachtet. Im Stadtkreis ist die Kaufaktivit\u00e4t aktuell hoch. Zusammenfassend l\u00e4sst sich entsprechend festhalten:\n\nIm Rahmen der massiven Kostenexplosionen im Energiebereich hat die Regierung auch f\u00fcr Heiz\u00f6l und Pellets Zuschussm\u00f6glichkeiten angek\u00fcndigt. Dies geschieht jedoch nicht automatisch, sondern muss \u00fcber Antragstellung erfolgen. Aktuell hei\u00dft es, dass dann pro Haushalt Hilfen von bis zu 2000 Euro ausgezahlt werden k\u00f6nnen. Zuschussberechtigt sind alle, die \u00fcber eine Rechnung nachweisen k\u00f6nnen, dass sich im Vergleich zum Vorjahreskauf der Preis mindestens verdoppelt hat. Kein Geld vom Staat gibt es allerdings, wenn das Heizkostenplus im Vergleich zum Vorjahr weniger als 100 Euro betr\u00e4gt.\n\nDer Antrag muss auf Bundesland-Ebene bei der entsprechenden Beh\u00f6rde gestellt werden. Die eidesstattliche Erkl\u00e4rung zur Richtigkeit der Brennstoffrechnung gibt bei einem Mietverh\u00e4ltnis der Mieter ab, an den auch die Entlastung weitergereicht werden muss. Vom Bund geplant sind insgesamt 1,8 Milliarden Euro f\u00fcr diese Entlastungsma\u00dfnahme. Es wird berichtet, dass aus den norddeutschen Bundesl\u00e4ndern Niedersachsen, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Hamburg, Bremen und Schleswig-Holstein bereits im April Hilfen beantragt werden k\u00f6nnen. Th\u00fcringen hingegen plant den Beginn der Antragsstellung Anfang Mai und in Berlin sind die Hilfen bereits verf\u00fcgbar. Um genaue Informationen zu erhalten, empfiehlt es sich, die Seiten des jeweiligen Landesministeriums zu besuchen. In den meisten F\u00e4llen ist entweder das Wirtschafts- oder das Sozialministerium zust\u00e4ndig.\n\nNeben dem \u00e4lteren Standard\u00f6l gibt es inzwischen auch schwefelarme Heiz\u00f6le sowie Bio- oder Premiumvarianten. H\u00f6herwertige \u00d6le k\u00f6nnen zwar von den Durchschnittspreisen abweichen und den Geldbeutel damit kurzfristig st\u00e4rker belasten, langfristig jedoch die Lebensdauer der Heizanlage positiv beeinflussen. Wenn Ihre Heizanlage einen gr\u00fcnen Deckel besitzt, sollten Sie ohnehin nur schwefelarme Heiz\u00f6le nutzen. Falls Sie auf Bio oder Premium wechseln wollen, sei jedoch dazu geraten, dies nur in Absprache mit einem Heizungsprofi oder dem Hersteller der Anlage zu realisieren.\n\nDie Ursache f\u00fcr die schwankenden Preise liegt abseits von wirtschaftspolitischen Entwicklungen und dem B\u00f6rsengeschehen auch im lokal unterschiedlichen Verbrauch. Der Studie des Bundesverbandes der Energie- und Wasserwirtschaft e.V. (BDEW) \"Wie heizt Deutschland?\" (2019) zufolge wird in Sachsen-Anhalt sowie den drei Stadtstaaten in weniger als 100.000 Wohngeb\u00e4uden mit \u00d6l geheizt, wohingegen es sich in Bayern, Nordrhein-Westfalen und Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg um mehr als eine Million handelt. Weiterhin spielt auch das Alter der Heizanlagen f\u00fcr den Verbrauch eine Rolle, die besonders im S\u00fcden des Landes in vielen F\u00e4llen \u00e4lter als 25 Jahre sind. Kein Wunder also, dass bei einer derart unterschiedlichen Nachfrage auch die Preisentwicklung betroffen ist - und das kann f\u00fcr viele sehr teuer werden. Wer sich allerdings gut auf seine Heiz\u00f6lbestellung vorbereitet und die Preise stets im Blick hat, kann dabei gewaltig sparen!\n\nIn der Bundesrepublik Deutschland liegt der Anteil in der BDEW-Studie f\u00fcr \u00d6l (Zentralheizung, \u00d6l\u00f6fen) in Wohngeb\u00e4uden bei 30,4%. Das bedeutet, dass hierzulande 5,8 Millionen Wohngeb\u00e4ude insgesamt mit Heiz\u00f6l versorgt werden m\u00fcssen. Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg geh\u00f6rt mit einer Million Wohngeb\u00e4uden, in denen mit \u00d6l geheizt wird und einen Anteil von 41,8% zu den gr\u00f6\u00dferen Heiz\u00f6l-Verbrauchern der Republik.\n\n1. Vermeiden Sie Notbestellungen: Wer zu lange mit der Bestellung wartet, sitzt entweder irgendwann im Kalten oder hat keine M\u00f6glichkeit mehr, zu einem guten Preis zu kaufen. Bestellen Sie deshalb rechtzeitig, so k\u00f6nnen Sie die Schwankungen beobachten und sich an einem Tag f\u00fcr den Kauf entscheiden, an dem der Preis g\u00fcnstig ist.\n\n2. Kooperieren Sie mit Familie, Nachbarn und Bekannten: Bei der Heiz\u00f6lbestellung kommt es nicht nur auf die tagesgenaue Preisentwicklung pro Liter an, sondern auch auf die Menge, die man kauft! Sprechen Sie mit Nachbarn, Familienmitgliedern und Bekannten ab, ob diese sich mit Ihnen vielleicht f\u00fcr eine Sammelbestellung zusammenschlie\u00dfen wollen. Dabei k\u00f6nnen alle Beteiligten nur profitieren!\n\n3. Verfolgen Sie den Heiz\u00f6l-Markt ganzj\u00e4hrig: Ein Blick in die Vergangenheit zeigt, dass sich besonders g\u00fcnstige Preise nicht auf eine bestimmte Zeit im Jahr zur\u00fcckf\u00fchren lassen. Neben dem Jahreszeit-bedingten Verbrauch spielen weltpolitische und weltwirtschaftliche Entwicklungen eine gro\u00dfe Rolle. Pr\u00fcfen Sie deshalb in regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Abst\u00e4nden \u00fcber das Jahr verteilt die Preise, um den richtigen Zeitraum nicht zu verpassen.\n\n4. Sparen Sie langfristig durch Modernisierung: Im Vergleich zu alten Modellen k\u00f6nnen moderne \u00d6l-Brennwertheizungen j\u00e4hrlich ein Einsparpotenzial im zweistelligen Prozentbereich bewirken. Die Umstellung auf andere Ressourcen erzielt dar\u00fcber hinaus sogar noch h\u00f6here Spar-Ertr\u00e4ge und wird zudem staatlich bezuschusst.\n\nDie Heiz\u00f6lpreise in diesem Artikel werden t\u00e4glich einmal aktualisiert (zuletzt am 27.07.2023 um 09.47 Uhr). Bitte beachten Sie, dass sich Preise im Verlauf des Tages ver\u00e4ndern k\u00f6nnen. Speichern Sie diese Webseite gern als Lesezeichen in Ihrem Browser ab, um \u00fcber die aktuellen Preisentwicklungen in Pforzheim informiert zu bleiben.\n\nEnergie ist als Thema nicht nur in aller Munde, sondern inzwischen auch eine Frage des Geldbeutels: Wenn Sie z.B. planen, von \u00d6l auf Gas umzustellen, erhalten Sie hier auf news.de auch spannende Informationen zum Gasverbrauch.",

        "title": "Heiz\u00f6lpreise Hochtaunuskreis aktuell: Die neuesten Entwicklungen am Heiz\u00f6l-Markt",
        "body": "Nicht erst seit dem Krieg in der Ukraine ver\u00e4ndert sich in Deutschland die Energiesituation und doch haben wir hier im vergangenen Jahr erstmals ausf\u00fchrlich \u00fcber Preise, Verbrauch und Einsparm\u00f6glichkeiten der deutschen Spitzen-Ressource Gas gesprochen. Weniger im Fokus stand dabei eine im Winter f\u00fcr viele Haushalte nach wie vor bedeutsame Energiequelle: das Heiz\u00f6l.\n\nHeiz\u00f6lpreise, Prognosen zur Preisentwicklung und Lieferzeiten schwanken in der Bundesrepublik stetig und unterscheiden sich nicht nur tagesaktuell, sondern auch regional sehr stark. In Hessen kosten 100 Liter durchschnittlich aktuell 99,30 Euro. Wie genau steht es im Hochtaunuskreis um den Heiz\u00f6l-Preis und welche aktuellen Lieferfristen gibt es?\n\nWenn Sie heute Heiz\u00f6l kaufen, bezahlen Sie im Durchschnitt im Hochtaunuskreis f\u00fcr 100 Liter 97,85 Euro. Damit liegt der Preis im Hochtaunuskreis unter dem Durchschnitt von Hessen. Beachten Sie, dass sich dieser Wert auf den Kauf von 3000 Litern bezieht. Entsprechend variiert der Preis, wenn Sie eine andere Menge Heiz\u00f6l erwerben.\n\nDie Daten in der folgenden Tabelle zeigen den Durchschnittspreis pro 100 Liter, wobei die Gebiete aller Postleitzahlen aus dem gesamten Landkreis zusammengefasst werden (zuletzt aktualisiert am 27.07.2023).\n\nQuelle: heizoel24.de\n\nUm die Kaufpreise f\u00fcr Heiz\u00f6l richtig einordnen zu k\u00f6nnen, lohnt sich immer ein Blick auf die Preisentwicklung. Die folgende Tabelle bietet Ihnen einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die Durchschnittspreise im Hochtaunuskreis des letzten Monats. Ausgegangen wird hier von einer gekauften Menge von 3000 Litern und angegeben ist der Preis f\u00fcr 100 Liter.\n\nDas Preisniveau von heute ist im Vergleich zum durchschnittlichen Preisniveau des letzten Jahres sehr niedrig. Derzeit funktioniert die Heiz\u00f6lbestellung relativ unproblematisch, wobei die Lieferfrist im Hochtaunuskreis im Schnitt aktuell 24 Arbeitstage umfasst. Die Preisentwicklungen am Markt werden aktuell wieder st\u00e4rker von Verbrauchern beobachtet. Im Landkreis ist die Kaufaktivit\u00e4t aktuell sehr hoch. Zusammenfassend l\u00e4sst sich entsprechend festhalten:\n\nIm Rahmen der massiven Kostenexplosionen im Energiebereich hat die Regierung auch f\u00fcr Heiz\u00f6l und Pellets Zuschussm\u00f6glichkeiten angek\u00fcndigt. Dies geschieht jedoch nicht automatisch, sondern muss \u00fcber Antragstellung erfolgen. Aktuell hei\u00dft es, dass dann pro Haushalt Hilfen von bis zu 2000 Euro ausgezahlt werden k\u00f6nnen. Zuschussberechtigt sind alle, die \u00fcber eine Rechnung nachweisen k\u00f6nnen, dass sich im Vergleich zum Vorjahreskauf der Preis mindestens verdoppelt hat. Kein Geld vom Staat gibt es allerdings, wenn das Heizkostenplus im Vergleich zum Vorjahr weniger als 100 Euro betr\u00e4gt.\n\nDer Antrag muss auf Bundesland-Ebene bei der entsprechenden Beh\u00f6rde gestellt werden. Die eidesstattliche Erkl\u00e4rung zur Richtigkeit der Brennstoffrechnung gibt bei einem Mietverh\u00e4ltnis der Mieter ab, an den auch die Entlastung weitergereicht werden muss. Vom Bund geplant sind insgesamt 1,8 Milliarden Euro f\u00fcr diese Entlastungsma\u00dfnahme. Es wird berichtet, dass aus den norddeutschen Bundesl\u00e4ndern Niedersachsen, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Hamburg, Bremen und Schleswig-Holstein bereits im April Hilfen beantragt werden k\u00f6nnen. Th\u00fcringen hingegen plant den Beginn der Antragsstellung Anfang Mai und in Berlin sind die Hilfen bereits verf\u00fcgbar. Um genaue Informationen zu erhalten, empfiehlt es sich, die Seiten des jeweiligen Landesministeriums zu besuchen. In den meisten F\u00e4llen ist entweder das Wirtschafts- oder das Sozialministerium zust\u00e4ndig.\n\nNeben dem \u00e4lteren Standard\u00f6l gibt es inzwischen auch schwefelarme Heiz\u00f6le sowie Bio- oder Premiumvarianten. H\u00f6herwertige \u00d6le k\u00f6nnen zwar von den Durchschnittspreisen abweichen und den Geldbeutel damit kurzfristig st\u00e4rker belasten, langfristig jedoch die Lebensdauer der Heizanlage positiv beeinflussen. Wenn Ihre Heizanlage einen gr\u00fcnen Deckel besitzt, sollten Sie ohnehin nur schwefelarme Heiz\u00f6le nutzen. Falls Sie auf Bio oder Premium wechseln wollen, sei jedoch dazu geraten, dies nur in Absprache mit einem Heizungsprofi oder dem Hersteller der Anlage zu realisieren.\n\nDie Ursache f\u00fcr die schwankenden Preise liegt abseits von wirtschaftspolitischen Entwicklungen und dem B\u00f6rsengeschehen auch im lokal unterschiedlichen Verbrauch. Der Studie des Bundesverbandes der Energie- und Wasserwirtschaft e.V. (BDEW) \"Wie heizt Deutschland?\" (2019) zufolge wird in den drei Stadtstaaten sowie in Sachsen-Anhalt in weniger als 100.000 Wohngeb\u00e4uden mit \u00d6l geheizt, wohingegen es sich in Nordrhein-Westfalen, Bayern und Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg um mehr als eine Million handelt. Weiterhin spielt auch das Alter der Heizanlagen f\u00fcr den Verbrauch eine Rolle, die besonders im S\u00fcden des Landes in vielen F\u00e4llen \u00e4lter als 25 Jahre sind. So wundert es kaum, dass bei einer derart unterschiedlichen Nachfrage auch die Preisentwicklung betroffen ist - und das kann f\u00fcr viele sehr teuer werden. Wer sich allerdings gut auf seine Heiz\u00f6lbestellung vorbereitet und die Preise stets im Blick hat, kann dabei gewaltig sparen!\n\nIn der Bundesrepublik Deutschland liegt der Anteil in der BDEW-Studie f\u00fcr \u00d6l (Zentralheizung, \u00d6l\u00f6fen) in Wohngeb\u00e4uden bei 30,4%. Das meint, dass hierzulande 5,8 Millionen Wohngeb\u00e4ude insgesamt mit Heiz\u00f6l versorgt werden m\u00fcssen. Mit 40% an mit \u00d6l beheizten Wohngeb\u00e4uden geh\u00f6rt Hessen zu den Bundesl\u00e4ndern mit einem starken Verbrauch. Immerhin 0,6 Millionen Wohngeb\u00e4ude nutzen hier weiterhin Heiz\u00f6l.\n\n1. Vermeiden Sie Notbestellungen: Wer zu lange mit der Bestellung wartet, sitzt entweder irgendwann im Kalten oder hat keine M\u00f6glichkeit mehr, zu einem guten Preis zu kaufen. Bestellen Sie deshalb rechtzeitig, so k\u00f6nnen Sie die Schwankungen beobachten und sich an einem Tag f\u00fcr den Kauf entscheiden, an dem der Preis g\u00fcnstig ist.\n\n2. Kooperieren Sie mit Familie, Nachbarn und Bekannten: Bei der Heiz\u00f6lbestellung kommt es nicht nur auf die tagesgenaue Preisentwicklung pro Liter an, sondern auch auf die Menge, die man kauft! Sprechen Sie mit Nachbarn, Familienmitgliedern und Bekannten ab, ob diese sich mit Ihnen vielleicht f\u00fcr eine Sammelbestellung zusammenschlie\u00dfen wollen. Dabei k\u00f6nnen alle Beteiligten nur profitieren!\n\n3. Verfolgen Sie den Heiz\u00f6l-Markt ganzj\u00e4hrig: Ein Blick in die Vergangenheit zeigt, dass sich besonders g\u00fcnstige Preise nicht auf eine bestimmte Zeit im Jahr zur\u00fcckf\u00fchren lassen. Neben dem Jahreszeit-bedingten Verbrauch spielen weltpolitische und weltwirtschaftliche Entwicklungen eine gro\u00dfe Rolle. Pr\u00fcfen Sie deshalb in regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Abst\u00e4nden \u00fcber das Jahr verteilt die Preise, um den richtigen Zeitraum nicht zu verpassen.\n\n4. Sparen Sie langfristig durch Modernisierung: Im Vergleich zu alten Modellen k\u00f6nnen moderne \u00d6l-Brennwertheizungen j\u00e4hrlich ein Einsparpotenzial im zweistelligen Prozentbereich bewirken. Die Umstellung auf andere Ressourcen erzielt dar\u00fcber hinaus sogar noch h\u00f6here Spar-Ertr\u00e4ge und wird zudem staatlich bezuschusst.\n\nDie Heiz\u00f6lpreise in diesem Artikel werden t\u00e4glich einmal aktualisiert (zuletzt am 27.07.2023 um 09.49 Uhr). Bitte beachten Sie, dass sich Preise im Verlauf des Tages ver\u00e4ndern k\u00f6nnen. Speichern Sie diese Webseite gern als Lesezeichen in Ihrem Browser ab, um \u00fcber die aktuellen Preisentwicklungen im Hochtaunuskreis informiert zu bleiben.\n\nEnergie ist als Thema nicht nur in aller Munde, sondern inzwischen auch eine Frage des Geldbeutels: Wenn Sie z.B. planen, von \u00d6l auf Gas umzustellen, erhalten Sie hier auf news.de auch spannende Informationen zum Gasverbrauch.",

Hay 17 personas detenidas en Melilla (11) y Granada (6) -entre las que se encuentran responsables y jugadores de un equipo de f\u00fatbol de la 3\u00aa divisi\u00f3n RFEF- por la presunta comisi\u00f3n de los delitos de pertenencia a organizaci\u00f3n criminal, corrupci\u00f3n entre particulares en el \u00e1mbito deportivo, estafa, blanqueo de capitales y falsedad documental.\n\nLos agentes, fruto de los registros realizados en una agencia de viajes de la ciudad de Melilla y en la Real Federaci\u00f3n Melillense de F\u00fatbol, han intervenido numerosa documentaci\u00f3n y dispositivos electr\u00f3nicos relacionados con los hechos investigados. Por otra parte, la colaboraci\u00f3n del Servicio de Investigaci\u00f3n Global del Mercado de Apuestas (SIGMA) ha resultado determinante.\n\nLa investigaci\u00f3n se inici\u00f3 el pasado mes de febrero cuando la Direcci\u00f3n General de Ordenaci\u00f3n del Juego, dependiente del Ministerio de Consumo, puso en conocimiento de los agentes la existencia de varias alertas recibidas de diferentes casas de apuestas online. \u00c9stas informaban de las sospechas sobre m\u00faltiples apuestas realizadas desde Melilla a resultados concretos de partidos de f\u00fatbol disputados por un equipo de la ciudad aut\u00f3noma.\n\nDe forma paralela, LALIGA inform\u00f3 de una comunicaci\u00f3n an\u00f3nima recibida a trav\u00e9s de su canal de denuncias, en la que alertaban sobre pr\u00e1cticas sospechosas de ese mismo equipo de f\u00fatbol relacionadas con ama\u00f1os deportivos, as\u00ed como con irregularidades en el cobro de ayudas y subvenciones cuyo dinero se destinaba a realizar apuestas deportivas.\n\nEl presidente del equipo de gestionaba los ama\u00f1os haciendo part\u00edcipes a jugadores de su confianza. Una vez recibida y analizada la informaci\u00f3n, los agentes identificaron un complejo entramado criminal evidenciando que el propiopresidente del equipo, haciendo part\u00edcipe a jugadores de su confianza, era quien presuntamente gestionaba los ama\u00f1os deportivos. Los jugadores, adem\u00e1s, se val\u00edan de terceras personas de su entorno para materializar las apuestas y evitar as\u00ed servinculados con las apuestas realizadas y los partidos disputados.\n\nLa investigaci\u00f3n se centr\u00f3 en los partidos disputados en el \u00faltimo tramo de la competici\u00f3n -una vez consumado el descenso del equipo investigado-,momento en el que las casas de apuestas alertaron de la recepci\u00f3n de una gran cantidad de apuestas a resultados concretos, o a resultados muy abultados, con la ciudad de Melilla como epicentro de las mismas.\n\nPor otra parte, las gestiones policiales practicadas han acreditado que el mismo club deportivo ha sido beneficiario de subvenciones utilizadas previsiblemente de forma fraudulenta con las que aumentaban los importes a cobrar.\n\nLa colaboraci\u00f3n del Servicio de Investigaci\u00f3n Global del Mercado de Apuestas (SIGMA) ha resultado determinante para esclarecer los hechos. Asimismo, EUROPOL ha participado activamente en la explotaci\u00f3n de la operaci\u00f3n, a trav\u00e9s de una oficina m\u00f3vil desplegada en la ciudad de Melilla, con tareas operativas de extracci\u00f3n de informaci\u00f3n de los dispositivos electr\u00f3nicos y los terminales telef\u00f3nicos.\n\nFinalmente, la operaci\u00f3n ha permitido arrestar a 17 personas -11 en la ciudad aut\u00f3noma de Melilla y 6 en Granada- vinculadas al club deportivoinvestigado as\u00ed como a otros equipos con los que se enfrent\u00f3.\n\nLa operaci\u00f3n contin\u00faa abierta.

        "title": "UN Charter and Delta state Born Physically Challenged 'Keke' Operator In Lagos | Latest Nigeria News Today",
        "body": "Acting on a recent emotional words and compassionate description by a professional colleague of one resourceful 32 years old Mr. Gift Captain Tonmene, a Delta state born but Lagos based physically challenged tricycle (Keke) operator in Mile 12 area of the state, I took a trip in the evening of Monday July 2023 to Mile 12 Motor Park, Lagos, to ascertain my friend's narrative.\n\nAside from coming face to face with the man in question which of course satisfied my journalist instinct for social justice as well as nourished my curiosity for bringing to the surface, societal ills to where they could be seen and addressed, my conversation with him on the other hand, was more revealing than expected.\n\nFirst, separate from consolidating the belief by Nigerians with critical minds that neglect of physically challenged and other vulnerable Nigerians by those in the position of authority has finally become a reality all Nigerians of good will must worry about, the 'meeting' gave further fillip to how poverty and deprivation have undeniably scarred our nation, dirtied our honour and diminished our pride as a nation.\n\nSpeaking on that day, at time and in that place, the 32 years old Tonmene, who was seated in his tricycle explained that he is married and blessed with a child. He is of Ijaw ethnic nationality and hails precisely from Tuomo in Burutu Local Government Area of Delta state.\n\nTragically unique was his revelation that he got crippled at the age of two under a mysterious circumstance.\n\nAccording to him, he started walking like every other normal child of his age when he was a year old but got crippled to the consternation of his relations at age two while in his sleep one fateful night. He lamented that the mystery surrounding that unusual and unnatural occurrence is yet to be unmasked 30 years after.\n\nAsked if he is fulfilled as Keke operator, the Ijaw born Tonmene stressed that operating a tricycle as a means of livelihood, to him could be likened to taking a fish out of water, insisting that if given needed support, he would switch to a more structured business like sales of Tricycle parts which he had earlier underwent apprenticeship for three years.\n\nTonmene further stated that he detests the act of begging for survival and that informed his decision to become Keke operator. He, however, lamented that operating a tricycle with his current physical state is laced with a lot of stress, frustration and hazards.\n\n'Each time the tricycle suddenly breaks down, i live at the mercy of passer byes as i can neither push nor single handedly rectify the challenge\"\n\nWhile he argued that he took to riding tricycle because 'preferable was not available', the Ijaw born Captain submitted that if given the needed financial support, he will abandon Keke for his first 'love' which is the sales of tricycle parts as that will avail him more profit while providing needed comfort to his young family.\n\nIn his words, I believe in the dignity of labour and that is why I cannot be a beggar. I don't have the capacity to beg and that is more reason why I want to work and feed my family. If I am given the necessary financial support needed to establish the business that I learnt (sales of tricycle parts), I will definitely leave Keke and invest in that business. I am sure that I will excel and most importantly, doing the business will provide me and my family the needed comfort and take effective care of our financial demands''.\n\nI lived in Bayelsa state for some years before I decided to come to Lagos to seek my daily bread. I like Lagos and if I am assisted, I will establish my business here in Lagos. Sanwolu is a good man. Delta state Governor, my governor is equally a good man. I know they will assist me. He said.\n\nContinuing, Captain pointed out that he never considered his condition a disability or allowed it to stop him from achieving his set objectives in life. This fact, according to him, explains why he crawled without clutches to the school all through his primary and secondary school days until he was given clutches in 2010 by good spirited individuals.\n\nWhile he observes that the harsh economic situation was made worse by the fact that his wife is presently unemployed, Tonmene decried, a situation where he has to pay one thousand three hundred naira (N1300) on daily basis as levies to different authorities and task forces in the state before he could be allowed to operate his tricycle in Lagos state. He however appreciated the Chairman, Tricycle Operators Association in the locality, whom he said gave him a waiver to be paying only N1300, while other operators pay far more.\n\nHe, therefore, called on Lagos state he called on the Executive Governor of Lagos state, Mr. Babajide Sanwolu, his Delta state and Bayelsa counterpart, Rt Honourable Elder Sheriff Oborevwori, well meaning Ijaw brothers and sisters, religious bodies, corporate organizations, Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) within and out Nigeria to urgently come to his rescue in his present time of need.\n\nFor me, while Tonmene call is understandable and appreciated, it is my view that it is our collective responsibility to look out for one another and perform the responsibility of care at the most fundamental levels.\n\nAnd, if nothing is done by both state and Federal Governments to save and serve Tonmene and other disabled Nigerians, it will again confirm as true the age long argument that ' the most stubborn refusal to admit the need for change in Nigeria is always coming from the very people who are running the country and it will be pretty tough to any form of positive progress in the country if such 'culture' is left unaddressed.\n\nAgain, what troubles me in addition to the above concern is that Nigeria is a long standing member of various organs of the United Nation and on the issue of human rights of persons with disabilities at the international level, the United Nations Charter affirms the essentiality of \"a universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction\".\n\nGoing by reports, the rights of individuals with disabilities are grounded in a human rights framework based on the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, international covenants on human rights and related human rights instruments.\n\nPersons with disabilities, the report added, are entitled to exercise their civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights on an equal basis with others under all the international treaties. The full participation of persons with disabilities benefits society as their individual contributions enrich all spheres of life and this is an integral part of individual's and society's well-being and progress for a society for all - with or without disabilities.\n\nIn a similar vein, the rights of individuals with disabilities have in another report, been addressed more generally throughout the development of the international human rights law. The principle of the right to equality, addressed throughout the normative standards set out by the international human rights instruments, is the foundation of the rights of individuals with disabilities. In order that the rights of persons with disabilities may be further realized, contemporary international law has increasingly recognized the need for all states to incorporate human rights standards into their national legislation.\n\nTo win, this piece calls on Federal Government and affected states to choose the best means to promote full realization of economic, social and cultural rights of Mr. Gift Captain Tonmene and other persons with disabilities in Nigeria particularly as there is no country exempted from the need for improved policies and laws for individuals with disabilities.",

Despr\u00e9s del debat en pon\u00e8ncia i comissi\u00f3, aquest dijous ha arribat al ple, on ha tirat endavant amb 113 vots a favor, del PSC, ERC, Junts, la CUP, els comuns i el PP. Nom\u00e9s l'extrema dreta de Vox s'hi ha oposat, mentre Ciutadans i el diputat no adscrit Antonio Gallego s'han abstingut.\n\nA m\u00e9s d'augmentar les indemnitzacions, la iniciativa tamb\u00e9 inclou mesures perqu\u00e8 l'autor o inductor de viol\u00e8ncia masclista no pugui administrar les indemnitzacions per als fills menors d'edat, amb la suspensi\u00f3 cautelar del pagament de les ajudes fins que no compleixin els 18 anys.\n\nEn defensa de la iniciativa, la diputada del PSC Beatriz Silva ha assegurat que \"els feminicidis s\u00f3n la forma m\u00e9s extrema de la viol\u00e8ncia masclista\", \"l'expressi\u00f3 m\u00e9s dram\u00e0tica de la desigualtat entre homes i dones\" i \"l'expressi\u00f3 d'un terror que soscava la democr\u00e0cia\". En aquest sentit, la parlament\u00e0ria socialista ha defensat que \"dedicar recursos hauria de ser una prioritat de totes les administracions\", tamb\u00e9 de la Generalitat, i ha assegurat que aquesta reforma \"permetr\u00e0 un acc\u00e9s efectiu\" a aquestes ajudes, que s'augmenten \"de forma significativa\".\n\nNom\u00e9s Vox en contra\n\nLa reforma de les ajudes a les v\u00edctimes de viol\u00e8ncia masclista i vic\u00e0ria ha comptat amb un suport pr\u00e0cticament un\u00e0nime de la cambra catalana, amb l'\u00fanica excepci\u00f3 de Vox. La diputada d'extrema dreta M\u00f2nica Lora ha denunciat la \"crueltat de la ideologia de g\u00e8nere\" i que \"aquesta i altres lleis s\u00f3n retrocessos per a la igualtat entre homes i dones\". Davant d'una llei que parla de la p\u00e8rdua de la mare, Lora ha preguntat: \"I la p\u00e8rdua d'un pare? Fins aquest punt els fa arribar el seu fanatisme\".",

        "body": "Noronex to extend footprint over Kalahari Copper BeltDoug BrightSponsoredThu, 27 July 2023 4:53PM\n\nNoronex is seeking to extend its Kalahari Copper Belt footprint after lodging two new full permit applications over 1650 square kilometres of prospective ground at the eastern extremity of its granted and fully-owned Humpback project area in Namibia.\n\nThe applications are adjacent to the Namibia-Botswana border and the southern boundary of Humpback and will bring the company's exploration portfolio area in Namibia to about 8700sq km, including about 3500sq km of permits under application.\n\nNoronex's growing portfolio embraces the highly-prospective, but relatively underexplored, transnational Kalahari Copper Belt, which runs north-east from central Namibia to north-eastern Botswana.\n\nMost significantly, it takes in a massive 300km strike of the sheared contact between the Ngwana Pan Formation and the overlying Lower D'Kar Formation (the NPF-D'Kar contact) that has long been recognised as a key contact zone hosting copper and silver mineralisation throughout the Kalahari Copper Belt.\n\nThe application area has been explored previously, most recently by Kopore Metals and Sandfire Resources. The companies drilled several holes and flew airborne magnetic and electromagnetic (EM) surveys, while other prior exploration was also undertaken by EISEB Exploration and Mining in a joint venture with Cupric Canyon and Antofagasta.\n\nAbout 50 holes were drilled by past explorers within the new application area. Between 2012 and 2013, exploration by EISEB defined several regional targets, which it tested by reverse-circulation (RC) and diamond drilling.\n\nEISEB drilled 32 holes in the application area and hit encouraging copper intercepts along the key NPF-D'Kar contact, including separate sections in four holes of 11m at 0.54 per cent copper from 152m, 2m at 0.84 per cent from 180m, 5.4m at 0.59 per cent from 219m and 8.7m at 0.41 per cent from 275m. It further confirmed that the NPF-D'Kar contact prospectivity was developed on or associated with known and partly-mapped antiformal or domal structures.\n\nThe new permit applications come hard on the heels of Noronex's recent contract signing to kick off its maiden 4000m RC drilling program by the end of the month to test its copper-silver exploration targets at both its Blowhole and Fiesta prospects within Humpback.\n\nBlowhole is about 10km north of the new ground and less than 10km west of the Botswana border. Aeromagnetic surveys confirm Blowhole's direct strike continuity with the same sheared antiformal D'Kar-NPF contact that hosts mineralisation at Cobre's Ngami and Thul prospects, which are less than 100km to the north-east. Cobre has reported several encouraging intersections from the site, including 10.7m at 1.3 per cent copper under shallow cover.\n\nNoronex says it plans to drill five holes at Blowhole - the first ever put into the prospect.\n\nFiesta is about 130km south-west along strike from Blowhole and lies on the western closure of a domal structure on the prospective NPF-D'Kar contact. Anomalous drill intercepts at Fiesta have hallmarks of the deposits defined in Botswana over 400km to the east, including Cupric Canyon's Zone 5 project which holds 167 million tonnes at 2 per cent copper.\n\nConsidering the likely two-year approval process, Noronex's new applications seem well-timed strategically, with the Kalahari Copper Belt coming under increasing attention from explorers and good ground being rapidly snapped up.\n\nGiven the company's recently-granted tenure and new application areas at Humpback, combined with ongoing exploration at its Witvlei copper project and the domal structure on its Snowball joint venture, there appears to be plenty of work to keep it occupied.\n\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

HT has reviewed a copy of the report.\n\nThe committee was constituted by the green panel in January this year to conduct a study on the status of the carrying capacity of Mussoorie.\n\nThe status report has recommended that the expansion of construction activities should be avoided, and proper drainage and sewage systems need to be implemented in Mussoorie.\n\nThe committee has recommended that the registration of tourists should be done according to the carrying capacity of the area, especially the available parking space, guest room availability, among others.\n\nAlso Read:Rush at hills an invitation for virus to spread, warns Centre\n\n\"Tourists can be charged for visiting the Mussoorie area and the payment can be utilised for managing waste and cleanliness\", the report said.\n\nOn February 2, principal bench of NGT, while taking suo motu cognisance of a media report warning Joshimath-like situation in Mussoorie, had directed the Uttarakhand government to conduct a study of the carrying capacity of Mussoorie and formed a nine-member committee to suggest remedial measures for preventing environmental damage to the hill station.\n\nThe committee headed by the chief secretary, Uttarakhand, included representatives from the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology Dehradun; Govind Ballabh Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment, Almora, National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee, Kumaon University, Nainital, Space Application Centre, Ahmedabad and National Institute of Rock Mechanics, Bengaluru.\n\nThe report states that \"72.57% of the area in Mussoorie comes under forests and attracts the provisions of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The land under agriculture however has reduced on account of building construction. The population growth, increase in tourist in-flow has resulted in increased demand for water supply and requirement of sewage system and waste management\".\n\nThe committee has listed preventive and remedial measures that need to be undertaken for better planning and management of available resources in Mussoorie.\n\nFor tunnel and major civil structures projects like hotels and hospitals, the committee has suggested that detailed engineering geological and geotechnical investigations should be done according to BIS Codes and construction permission should only be granted after clearance of the report from the State/Centre appointed statutory body.\n\nAfter proper examination of existing buildings, the committee stated it may be necessary to strengthen the retrofitting of structures to prevent them from sliding or collapsing.\n\n\"This could involve underpinning or adding reinforcement to the foundations. Technical auditing of multi-story buildings (above three storeys) by experts on an annual or biennial basis can be conducted to know the health of the buildings.\n\nWhen repairing roads or building structures, the committee has recommended that the boulders should not be removed by digging or blasting the hillsides.\n\n\"In landslide-prone areas, stones and boulders should not be removed from the bottom of the hill because this would remove toe support, increasing the likelihood of landslides. It is necessary to fill in any cracks that have appeared on the slopes\", the report stated.\n\nThe committee has stressed the need for an effective drainage system in the hill town.\n\n\"Due to the lack of proper surface draining system, the rainwater of most of the buildings is being infiltrated into the ground which generates sub-surface flow and accelerates the process of land creeping resulting in damage to buildings and other properties causing economic and environmental disruptions\", the report said.\n\nThe committee has also suggested that phytoremediation (using plants to clean up the soil, air, and water that have been contaminated by chemicals) of degraded slopes can be initiated, which can help to anchor the soil and prevent erosion.\n\n\"Broad-leaved native trees can be promoted for stabilizing slopes, especially in the landslide-prone areas\", it said.\n\nThe committee has also suggested that recharge/rejuvenation of natural springs should be explored with scientific intervention.\n\n\"Natural springs in the region should be monitored and recharge activities (proper plantation) can be initiated on proper scientific basis. Springs (act as natural piezometers) are good indicators for any change in the groundwater in the mountainous area. Therefore, there is an urgent need to inventories all springs located in the vicinity/periphery of Mussoorie towns. Their periodic monitoring may be a good tool for detecting any natural calamities events in advance in the mountainous regions\", the report stated.\n\nThe committee has also recommended that rooftop rainwater harvesting can be promoted to meet the deficit water demand, at least during the peak tourist period.\n\n\"Open rainwater seepage must be stopped through the construction of a pucca drainage system. Water should not be allowed to accumulate in any depression; instead, drains should be built to transport it to safe areas. A proper sewerage network and appropriate treatment facilities should be ensured. The sewage water should not be allowed to percolate or connect with natural ground water. The feasibility of reuse of treated water for secondary uses can be explored\", the report said.\n\nThe report emphasised that the construction of new buildings is already restricted in Mussoorie, and such new/additional construction-related extension work should be properly monitored.\n\n\"All the building foundations should be mapped by a competent engineering geologist to know about the safe bearing capacity of the foundation and treatment of cut slope. In consultation with the designer, type of foundation (footing, strip, raft) and height of building can be finalised. Then only after this, the map can be submitted to MDDA (Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority) for approval.\n\nThe report also pointed out that the regulations related to waste management should be strictly followed.\n\n\"Dumping sites around water bodies should be strictly restricted to prevent pollution threats on the important sources of drinking water of the city. A QR code based Digital Direct Refund System should be implemented for management of plastic waste. Strict measures should be made to promote the usage of biodegradable materials and the ban on use of Single Use Plastics (SUPs) items should be strictly enforced\".\n\nFor better traffic management, the committee has suggested that the total number of permissible vehicles should not exceed the capacity of parking facilities available.",

The foundation is caring for orphans as part of a reintroduction program that will monitor their progress for over a decade. The foundation is partnering with Colossal on an extensive data-gathering operation, using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze the animals' behavior and pair it with genomic data on each elephant. \"We'll be able to mix the art of the elephant handlers with the science of today,\" argues Matt James, chief animal officer at Colossal. The AI will be fed video footage which has been interpreted by elephant handlers, so that over time it can learn about social behaviors and leadership models, for example. Colossal is also sequencing the genomes of Elephant Havens' orphans to conduct a gene-trait analysis of individuals, to see how their genetic information might be expressed in their behavior.",

        "body": "KOTA KINABALU (July 27): The state government has established a special Cabinet committee to address the issue of Self-Sufficiency Level (SSL) in the state.\n\nChief Minister Datuk Seri Panglima Hajiji Noor said the special committee would be headed by the state Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Industry (MAFFI).\n\n\"I am proud of the persistent efforts of MAFFI and the agencies under it as well as the Federal Government agencies that have united their efforts to achieve the goal of increasing the SSL production of all types of food in this state.\n\n\"Among the issues identified, related to the area of paddy fields that is getting smaller and smaller because it has been used for residential development and commercial shops.\n\nTo deal with this issue, the government has explored a new rice planting area in Trusan Sapi, Beluran covering about 2,000 acres.\n\n\"It is promoted in an integrated manner by MAFFI and its agencies, which are the Rural Development Corporation (KPD), the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Irrigation and Drainage with the involvement of the private sector and the people of Trusan Sapi as participants in rice planting,\" he said when officiating the state-level Farmers, Breeders and Fishermen's Day 2023 at Wisma Pertanian here on Thursday.\n\nThe text of his speech was read by Deputy Chief Minister I Datuk Seri Panglima Dr Jeffrey G Kitingan who is also the state Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Industry.\n\nThe Chief Minister said all the efforts taken by this government is to ensure sufficient food supply and produce more high-value agricultural products for commercial purposes that can stimulate the growth of the sector.\n\n\"The agriculture, fisheries and animal husbandry sectors have enormous potential to continue to be developed in this state.\n\n\"Emphasis is on value chain activities as a whole, namely increased production, collection of produce, more systematic processing and marketing as well as the use of the latest technology to guarantee sufficient food supply and the expansion of the export market abroad,\" he said.\n\nIn this regard, he said for the crop sub-sector, a total of RM115.39 million was allocated to the Agriculture Department to increase the production of various crops, to generate income for farmers from RM2,000 to RM4,000 per month.\n\n\"The government's efforts to help the B40 target group and the extreme poor will continue through the Rural Development Corporation with an allocation of RM20.28 million. A total of 2,015 participants will receive benefits from the implementation of various livestock and crop programs.\n\n\"In addition, KPD Smart System has been developed and will be used in KPD agricultural produce collection centers. In the fisheries sub-sector, the state government through the Department of Fisheries, Ko-Nelayan and SAFMA among others, will continue to implement various initiatives to guarantee sufficient fisheries supply in the state.\n\n\"Among them, encouraging young fishermen to farm fish in cages, cultivating seaweed, including exploring the downstream industry of processing fishery products by producing products such as Keropok Amplang,\" he added.\n\nHe further explained that a total of RM46.09 million was allocated to the Fisheries Department, this year, to continue various programs to guarantee the production of sustainable fishery products to cover the domestic and international markets.\n\n\"While for the livestock sector, Sabah still imports beef, goat meat, dairy products, chicken products and eggs. However, efforts are being made by the Sabah Veterinary Services Department through the Sabah Ruminant Industry Strengthening Project which is worth RM50 million.\n\n\"The department also cooperates with several GLCs through projects such as the Livestock Integration Project under Palm Oil (PINTAR), the Goat Livestock Project and the Livestock Transformation Program,\" he said.",

        "title": "Mawrth Vallis region - the deepest clay deposits on Mars",
        "body": "Enormous Martian valley once again the focus for HRSC\n\nOn 18 February 2023, Mars Express made a repeat flyover of the Mawrth Vallis region, one of the most distinctive and fascinating regions of the Red Planet, which is also of the greatest scientific interest. 'Mawrth' is the Welsh name for Mars. The image data were acquired 130 kilometres west of the outflow of Mawrth Vallis. Repeated imaging coverage at different times makes it possible to observe changes on the surface of Mars.\n\nOften, clouds or dust in the atmosphere cause variations in image quality, especially in this region at the transition between the southern highland regions and the northern lowlands of Mars, referred to as the highland-lowland or dichotomy boundary. Another reason for repeat observations is to obtain additional surface data for creating and improving terrain models and image mosaics. A large mosaic of this region was created in 2016, as was an animation showing an overflight of the region.\n\nScience fiction fans also know Mawrth Vallis as the location of the more than one-thousand-kilometre route followed by astronaut Mark Watney while stranded on Mars, in the novel 'The Martian' by Andy Weir. This book was later also filmed. In the end, Watney reached the rescue rocket Ares 4 in Schiaparelli Crater, which is located a little further southeast in Arabia Terra. In 2015, the DLR Institute of Planetary Research recreated this route with HRSC image data and computed a spectacular animation using digital terrain models derived from HRSC data. This video was shown in German-language cinemas as the opening credits to 'The Martian'.\n\nWas Mawrth Vallis once a place suitable for life?\n\nAlthough the region is considered one of the most promising locations to search for fossil or even present-day life on the Red Planet, it has not yet been selected as the landing site for a mission due to its difficult topography, as landings on steep terrain are hazardous. Light and dark coloured deposits are found in and around the Mawrth Vallis outflow. The light-coloured materials in particular are an indication of the previous presence of water. The largest deposits of hydrous phyllosilicates on Mars exist in and near Mawrth Vallis, forming deposits up to 200 metres deep in some places.\n\nOn Earth, such clay minerals often form as a weathering product of volcanic rocks that come into contact with water over long periods of time and are thus transformed. Therefore, an analogous formation process for these minerals is thought to have taken place on Mars. Spectrometer data were used to identify, among others, the smectite clay minerals nontronite and saponite, in whose crystal framework of silicon tetrahedra, in addition to aluminium and magnesium cations, 'water molecules' (hydroxyl ions, OH-) are also 'incorporated'.\n\nAbove the clays lies a dark stratum of rock that is thought to be of volcanic origin. Investigations with the Observatoire pour la Mineralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activite (OMEGA) spectrometer, also carried on board Mars Express, led to a better understanding of the iron-, magnesium- and aluminium-rich clay minerals. The different compositions of these clays testify to the different ages and degrees of weathering of the individual deposits. Sulphate-bearing deposits were also found on the floor of Mawrth Vallis, again indicating a different formation environment.\n\nIn addition to mineralogy, the large-scale stratification of the light-coloured rocks offers a unique opportunity to decipher the depositional conditions and the climatic history of Mars. The layered silicates on Mars could indicate surface weathering as a result of the action of water and therefore an environment that was potentially suitable for life in the past. Water once flowed through Mawrth Vallis and probably shaped the surface until 3.6 billion years ago. It is therefore possible that fossil traces of microbes have been preserved in the rocks, having been protected from destruction by radiation and erosion by the overlying rock layers. Astrobiologists have long been interested in this region of Mars.\n\nDiverse landscape structures and a 'muddy' impact\n\nThe 25-kilometre-wide impact crater on the far left in images 1, 6 and 7 has a depression or pit in its centre, whose northern wall has partially collapsed. Such 'central pit craters' are impact craters that often occur on Mars, due to its subsurface ice layers, and on ice-rich moons. The raised rims around the central pit strongly suggest that it was formed by a water vapour explosion.\n\nFurther to the right (north) in the images are large areas of light-coloured, clay-like materials. On closer inspection, they can also be found within the crater walls, for example in the smaller crater in the lower part of the images. The dark, volcanic overlying rock can also be seen in places, but is often heavily eroded. Further north, the terrain drops steeply, by more than a thousand metres into the lowland of Chryse Planitia. Two interconnected, old and heavily eroded impact craters are just visible in the plain (centre of image 1 and in perspective view, image 4). The larger one is approximately 75 kilometres across, while the smaller one is about 35 kilometres in diameter, - slightly larger than the 25-kilometre-wide Nordlinger Ries, an impact crater on Earth, located in Germany on the border between Wurttemberg and Bavaria.\n\nFurther north is a field with numerous mesas protruding from an otherwise flat plain: the larger mesas are up to three kilometres across and interpreted as remnants of a former, now eroded highland plain. Finally, in the upper right corner of the images, part of a 'fluidised' ejecta blanket can be seen. This is the result of an impact into a surface that contained subsurface water or ice. According to the prevailing model of Martian history, the ground ice was melted by the high impact energy. During such an impact, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of a mixture of water, rock and debris reach the surface and form these lobate ejecta blankets around the crater. These are characteristic of Mars and resemble mobilised mud.\n\nImage processing\n\nThe images were created using data acquired by the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on 18 February 2023 during Mars Express orbit 24,164. The ground resolution is approximately 18 metres per pixel. The images are centred at 339 degrees east and 25 degrees north. The colour image was created using data from the nadir channel, the field of view of which oriented perpendicular to the surface of Mars, and the colour channels.\n\nThe oblique perspective views were created using a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and data from the nadir channel and the colour channels. The anaglyph image, which gives a three-dimensional impression of the landscape when viewed with red/blue or red/green glasses, was derived using data from the nadir channel and one of the stereo channels. The colour-coded topographic view is based on a DTM of the region, from which the topography of the landscape can be derived. The reference body for the HRSC-DTM is a Martian equipotential surface (areoid).\n\nHRSC is a camera experiment developed and operated by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The systematic evaluation of the camera data was carried out at the DLR Institute of Planetary Research in Berlin-Adlershof. Personnel in the Department of Planetary Sciences and Remote Sensing at the Freie Universitat Berlin used these data to create the image products shown here.",

        "body": "To do that, the team is hoping to assess the target rocks, any evidence for the impactor, and the morphology of the craters. While the craters are very easy to see in orbital images, the view from the ground is a bit harder to assess, as seen in the above Navcam image.\n\nThe image shows some broken up blocks of bedrock in the foreground, and small depressions and ridges in the distance. Through a detailed imaging campaign and contact science, the team hopes to gain more insight into the origin of these features, before getting back on the road to continue climbing up Mount Sharp.\n\nToday's 3-sol plan focused on the crater cluster science with plenty of imaging and contact science. On the first sol, Curiosity will investigate the bedrock target \"La Trinite\" with DRT, MAHLI, and APXS, and a second target \"Rio Javari\" with MAHLI and APXS to better understand the target rock properties.\n\nThe team also planned two large Mastcam stereo mosaics to investigate the depth-to-diameter ratios and erosional state of several craters, and three ChemCam LIBS targets to assess variations in texture and chemistry of the local bedrock. Mastcam will also collect a multispectral observation of the DRT target, along with imaging to assess the movement of fines on the rover deck, and a small mosaic to investigate nearby troughs in the regolith.\n\nOn the second sol the rover will acquire a long distance ChemCam RMI mosaic looking back towards Peace Vallis - it's amazing to see how far we've come! The plan also includes environmental monitoring activities to look for clouds and dust devils and monitor dust in the atmosphere. Curiosity will drive on the third sol, which will hopefully bring us closer to one of the larger craters in this cluster for even more crater science next week!",

        "title": "Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5, Galaxy Watch 6 & Galaxy Tab S9 - all you need to know",
        "body": "Samsung took the wraps off its newest kit at its latest Galaxy Unpacked event. It was the first time the company hosted a launch event in its home city of Seoul in South Korea.\n\nThere are two new smartphones, the foldable Galaxy Z Fold 5 and the clamshell flip phone Galaxy Z Flip 5, along with three new tablets and two new smartwatches.\n\nAll the products arrive in stores on August 11.\n\nHere's everything you need to know...\n\nREAD MORE: 'Best flip phone' contender Razr 40 Ultra launched as Motorola takes aim at Samsung crown\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 4\n\nUnlike the other devices below, I've actually had a chance to briefly test this one out. The design of the Z Flip 5 has changed very little, but the big difference is it folds flat, so there's no gap. This is significant because it means dust and lint don't get into the gap. As a result, the phone is slimmer too. Z Flip 5 is 15.1 mm thick compared to the 17.1mm of its predecessor.\n\nThe cover display is the main change on Z Flip 5 and follows the example set by Motorola on its recently launched Razr 40 Ultra clamshell phone.\n\nSamsung's new 3.4in Super AMOLED panel has a 60Hz refresh rate and a resolution of 720 x 748 and 306 PPI. The cover display in theory means you have to open the phone out less. It provides access to 13 native widgets. A shortcut can be set to the camera app, or give you quick access to currently running activities. You can also reply to messages with a full QWERTY keyboard. And you can see basic information at a glance, such as time, weather, battery and notifications.\n\nI would say the new display looks nicer but I'm not sure it is a game-changer in everyday use. A full review later will hopefully answer that question.\n\nAs you would expect for a phone this expensive, Z Flip 5 is powered by the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 2 SoC (system on a chip). It comes with a sufficient but not earth-shattering 8GB of RAM and either 256GB or 512GB of storage.\n\nThe Z Flip 5 only supports 25W wired charging and the firm said it will charge from zero to 50 percent in roughly 30 minutes. I've tested some Android phones which can go from zero to 100 percent in less than 20 minutes.\n\nTo me the camera hardware seems unchanged from Z Flip 4: 12MP wide and ultrawide on the rear along with a 10MP front camera. The latter has a slightly better aperture. However, the software has improved and it's fair to say that even though the camera system is not flagship standard, many users will find the quality if images and video acceptable.\n\nThe main display is a 6.7in FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Infinity Flex panel with a resolution of 2640 x 1080 and a wide 22:9 aspect ratio. The LTPO tech means the refresh rate can switch between 1Hz and 120Hz. The difference is peak brightness is now higher, at 1600 nits.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip5 goes on sale August 11 and comes in Graphite, Cream, Lavender and Mint colours and the price starts at \u20ac1,239 for 256GB/8GB, which is an \u20ac80 price bump over a similarly specced Z Flip 4.\n\nGalaxy Z Fold 5\n\nThe next-generation foldable phone lands with a brighter screen, faster chip and a thinner design.\n\nSamsung has managed to lose 10g of weight and slim the phone down by 2.4mm compared to last year's Galaxy Z Fold 4, which it says was possible due to an improved hinge mechanism.\n\nZ Fold 5's primary screen is the same as last year, a 7.6in almost square display with a peak brightness of 1,750 nits and 120h refresh rate display.\n\nYou can read my review of the Galaxy Z Fold 4 here and the reasons I loved it all still apply to the Z Fold 5.\n\nIt's powered by the currently highest-end Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, and has 12GB RAM, which for a phone this expensive frustratingly falls short of the 16GB RAM that Asus includes on the ROG Phone 7 Utra. It also supports wireless charging and is rated IPX8 for water-resistance. The X, incidentally, means it isn't dust-resistant.\n\nPrices are \u20ac1,999 for 256GB, \u20ac2,109 for 512GB and \u20ac2,349 for 1TB.\n\nGalaxy Tab S9\n\nThere are three new Samsung tablets.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab S9 line-up is only slightly different from last year's Tab S8 models, but there are now OLED screens in all three models.\n\nThey all have screens that can refresh up to 120Hz for smooth scrolling and lower pen latency.\n\nThe sizes remain the same: 11in on Galaxy Tab S9, 12.4in on Galaxy Tab S9 Plus and an incredible 14.6in for the Tab S9 Ultra.\n\nThe 16:10 aspect ratios unfortunately means these tablets will work best in landscape mode and will be less useful for reading and other portrait-orientation uses than the likes of iPad and OnePlus Pad.\n\nSamsung has added water and dust resistance to the tablets for the first time.\n\nPrices are high for tablets, and thus will probably only suit those looking for a productivity device.\n\nGalaxy Tab S9 starts at \u20ac949 for a WiFi only 128GB model. Tab S9 Plus costs from \u20ac1,049 for a 256GB WiFi only model and Tab S9 Ultra costs from \u20ac1,399 all the way up to \u20ac1,949 for the top spec 1TB WiFi and Cellular model.\n\nGalaxy Watch 6 Series\n\nSamsung went back to the drawing board with the Galaxy Watch 6 and returned with a fan-favourite: the physical rotating bezel which was missing on the Watch 5 series.\n\nThis year there are two models, neither of which is called Pro.\n\nThere's the standard aluminium Galaxy Watch 6 and the stainless steel, bezel-bearing, Galaxy Watch 6 Classic.\n\nBoth share the same sensors as last year's Galaxy Watch 5, but have a bigger battery and larger screens.\n\nSamsung has slimmed the bezels to squeeze larger screens into both of these watches. Galaxy Watch 6 comes with either 40mm or 44mm screens, while the Watch 6 Classic is between 43mm and 47mm.\n\nFor the Galaxy Watch 6, Samsung has managed to shave 30 percent from the bezel compared to its predecessor, while the Watch 6 Classic enjoys a more modest 15 percent reduction because of the way spinning bezels are used to quickly scroll through menus.\n\nThe firm has increased the peak brightness on the new series - topping out at an impressive 2,000 nits (matching the Apple Watch Ultra and roughly twice what you'll see on Apple Watch Series 8), which should mean the screen stays visible outdoors even in the odd burst of direct sunlight that we see in Ireland.\n\nSamsung has increased the size of the battery inside the Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic to support the bigger, brighter, displays.\n\nOther new features include Irregular heart rate notifications, a new track run workout type and the option to create custom workouts.\n\nSmartThings Find locates your phone from the watch even when it's not connected, using GPS to determine its last location.\n\nI'm happy to learn that moving to a new phone no longer requires you to reset the watch and start from scratch. This is a frustration with a lot of smartwatches, so hopefully others follow Samsung's lead.\n\nThere are new watch bands too, including a redesigned Milanese loop and a hybrid eco band made from industrial corn.\n\nGalaxy Watch Series 6 goes on sale August 11. Galaxy Watch 6 will cost from \u20ac329 and Galaxy watch 6 Classic will cost from \u20ac429.\n\nSign up for our weekly Tech and gaming newsletter",

All the ingredients are there.\"\n\nAustralia's most recent destructive bushfire season was the Black Summer of 2019-20, which scorched more than 24 million hectares and directly killed 33 people.\n\nMr Musulin said while he expected significantly high summer temperatures, it was too early to say whether Australia would bake under extreme heatwaves similar to those that have gripped the northern hemisphere in places such as southern Europe and the United States.\n\nHe also warned the index showed signs that Australia's underlying climate had changed, indicating a longer-term trend of an increasing frequency of extreme weather.\n\n\"What the climate index is showing us is consistent with the warming climate,\" Mr Musulin said.",

        "body": "It has been a miserable few days and this July could even be the wettest on record - but all hope is not lost as a high pressure could return to our shores as soon as next week\n\nAn Irish weather expert has indicated when better conditions will return after a miserable few weeks of rainfall.\n\nThis July could the wettest on record as low pressure continues to dominate.\n\nThere has been what has felt like non-stop rain and barely any nice weather apart from a few weeks in June this summer.\n\nHowever, one weather expert has given a date for when better conditions could return - and it's very soon.\n\nWhile today is a washout, summer weather could come back to Ireland as soon as next Friday, August 4th.\n\nAlan O'Reilly, who runs the popular Carlow Weather Twitter account, posted snaps of sunny weather on Tuesday evening and wrote: \"A mighty evening and a reminder of what summer can be. Hopefully August has some more in store.\n\n\"The models are really struggling to agree beyond the weekend but still a chance of high pressure from the around the 4th.\"\n\nAccording to Met Eireann's long-term forecast for August, we could see a rise in temperatures and less rainfall than the washouts we've experienced in July.\n\nFor the week of July 31 to August 6, high pressure - which results in more settled weather conditions - is expected to become more dominant, meaning we can still hold out hope for some proper summer weather.\n\nA Met Eireann forecaster said: \"This week is expected to remain changeable with low pressure at the surface and also aloft dominating. It is expected to average out a little wetter than average but with probably lower rainfall totals than occurred in in the previous week.\n\n\"This is due to high pressure to the southwest of Ireland exerting an influence over the country too, and some largely dry periods can be expected at times. The potential for the heaviest showers looks to be over Ulster. Temperatures will be around average for the beginning of August. It may be breezy at times especially over Ulster coasts.\"\n\nGet the latest RSVP headlines straight to your inbox for free by signing up to our newsletter\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community!

        "body": "The captain and two other crew members of a Palau-flagged container ship that sunk off the coast of southern Taiwan last week have been barred from leaving the island. The travel ban was announced on Thursday in a Facebook post from the Ocean Affairs Council Minister Kuan Bi-ling (\u7ba1\u78a7\u73b2).\n\nThe container ship, known as the Angel, sank while anchored near the port of Kaohsiung for unknown reasons on July 20, and all 19 crew members were able to abandon the ship. The Taiwan International Ports Corporation (TIPC) stated that oil-stop lines and oil-absorbing cotton ropes were deployed to contain and prevent oil pollution. As of Thursday, 233 of the Angel's 1,349 empty containers have been hauled ashore, while 977 sank with the ship, according to TIPC.\n\nKuan says that in the event of a ship accident, Taiwanese law stipulates that shipowners must immediately take measures to prevent, eliminate, or reduce any marine pollution. She says the captain of the Angel did not take preventative actions, and that the burden of the cleanup was borne by the Taiwanese government. Kuan says that the costs of cleanup as well as losses to fishermen caused by the pollution are to be borne by the polluter. She adds that the shipowner should come forward and deal with the situation as soon as possible.",

The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) has found traces of explosives in the hold of a dry cargo vessel sailing via a Ukrainian port and the Kerch Strait to Rostov-on-Don to pick up a load of grain, the FSB told TASS on Thursday.\n\n\"On July 26, traces of explosives - dinitrotoluene and trotyl - were found in the hold of and on board a life boat of a foreign dry cargo vessel, BMO River, on its way from the port of Sinop, Turkey via the Kerch Strait to Rostov-on-Don to pick up a grain cargo. It was established that the vessel called at the Ukrainian seaport of Reni in the Odessa Region twice this June and July,\" the FSB reported.\n\nIt was decided to bar the vessel from passing under the arch of the Kerch Strait crossing and prohibit its further departure for waters beyond the territorial sea of the Russian Federation, the FSB added.\n\nOn Saturday, traces of explosives were found in the hold of another foreign cargo ship sailing from Turkey to Rostov-on-Don to pick up a grain cargo. According to the FSB, in late May the ship was docked in Ukraine's Danube River port of Kiliya. In July, it was located in the Turkish port of Tuzla, where the ship's crew was replaced entirely by a new crew, consisting of 12 Ukrainian citizens, and the vessel was renamed. The FSB said then that the abovementioned circumstances indicated that a foreign civilian ship might possibly have been used to deliver explosives to the territory of Ukraine. Back then, the vessel was also barred from passing via the Kerch Strait.",

Since that's no longer the case, we should lay the three-month summer break to rest, right?\n\nA teacher instructs students in a physical science class during summer school at Canoga Park High School in Los Angeles in 2022. Mel Melcon/Los Angeles Times/TNS\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nJonathan Zimmerman teaches education and history at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of \"Whose America? Culture Wars in the Public Schools.\"\n\nWe've heard that argument over and over again from politicians and other critics of summer vacation and all its parental and educational discontents. The COVID-19 pandemic, which spawned dramatic learning losses for America's students, only heightened concerns about long summer breaks. Our kids need more school, the reasoning goes, and summer is an obvious time to start.\n\nThey might be right about that, but the oft-repeated folk history is wrong. When our common school system began, in the early 19th century, students actually went to school in the summer. And if we want to bring them back today, we'll need new ways to teach them.\n\nWhen most Americans lived and worked on farms, the busy seasons were spring and fall - for planting and harvesting, respectively. So kids attended school in the winter and, yes, in the summer, as historian Kenneth Gold has explained.\n\nThat changed after the Civil War, during America's great industrial boom. As more families moved into cities, educators worried that summer school terms would make children susceptible to smallpox, diphtheria and the other epidemic diseases that flared in the hotter months.\n\nEducators also argued that keeping children inside during the summer would prevent them from enjoying the bounties of free outdoor play. \"Let Mary run and be as hedonist as she pleases; let Tommy roll in the mud,\" a Massachusetts observer wrote. \"They will be all the better for it, more hardy, blooming, and vigorous when vacation is over.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was just one problem: America's cities were filthy. Despite the romantic nods to nature and health, children who lived in urban areas were more likely to encounter grime and disease and, if left unsupervised, get into other kinds of trouble as well.\n\n\"Scores of the children will be seen sitting listlessly on the steps of the tenements or playing half-hearted games on the streets,\" a New Yorker worried of city summers in 1903. \"Many will be seen pitching pennies, or at games of cards, or playing craps. ... The sight of boys stealing fruit is not infrequent.\"\n\nEnter the \"vacation school,\" which early 20th-century reformers touted as an antidote to the boredom and danger of the streets. Prefiguring today's summer school advocates, who note that poor kids in particular lose academic skills during the summer, one advocate contended that vacation schools would \"prevent the demoralizing effect of the long weeks of idleness.\"\n\nBut they shouldn't simply repeat what kids did during the academic year, she added. To the contrary, vacation schools would also relieve the torpor and boredom of \"regular\" school. \"Pupils were allowed the freedom of the halls; they played bean bag ... danced, sang, and marched,\" a Denver superintendent wrote in praising his city's vacation schools in 1902.\n\nAs the 20th century continued, however, vacation schools lost their alternative edge. They evolved into summer school, which provided remedial instruction for kids who fell behind. And they also provided academic credit, subjecting them to all of the bureaucratic rules of regular school.\n\nThat gave summer school a negative taint that it has never lost. If we continue to treat summer school as an extension of regular school, we'll reinforce the stigma attached to summer school and the kids who attend it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Why should they have to sit in a building and do math all day while their higher-income peers are off in some fancy camp?\" asked Rand Corp. researcher Catherine Augustine, who studies summer education.\n\nIt's a good question, and there's only one answer: Summer school has to provide the kind of enrichment activities that well-to-do kids already receive in privately run summer camps and schools. Taking a page from the vacation school example, we should imagine it as a respite from the academic year rather than simply a recapitulation or extension of it.\n\nSome of that is already happening. In Orange County, Florida, summer schools are providing music and art enrichment alongside academic instruction; in Texas, they teach canoeing and swimming.\n\nMuch of this activity is funded by federal COVID aid to schools, 20% of which must be used to combat learning loss. That shouldn't be the only goal, however. Indeed, the most successful summer schools will be the ones that look the least like regular school.\n\nWe would also need to bring teachers aboard, which might be the biggest challenge of all. Exhausted and demoralized in the wake of the pandemic, many teachers have been cool to the idea of summer school.\n\nBut maybe, just maybe, a new take on summer schooling could connect more teachers with the passion and idealism that brought them into education in the first place. Our kids went to school in the summer when the nation was young. With the right approach - and the right people to teach them - they can do so again.\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

        "body": "Sir,\n\nThis has reference to the article 'Dogri-5 landmarks in its journey' by B D Sharma published in the Sunday Magazine of the Daily Excelsior.\n\nThe efforts expressing your contention of promoting Dogri language are really admirable and appreciable.Prior to 1962-63 we used to read Hindi, Urdu and Sanskrit as a optional subjects in 8th to 10th class but there was no Dogri subject as such. Earlier to 1970 there was a good trial to promote Dogri language through a Dogri Film \"Gallan Hoian Beettian\" screened by the local director / producer and local artists. It gained the popularity for some time but no solid results could be achieved. Awareness was put through also by the renowned Dogri poets.It is felt that unless this language is recocognised as a subject during schooling, chances are very less to achieve the target. It's my personal view.\n\nSK Sharma\n\nJammu\n\nII\n\nIt is a substantive piece Sharma ji which gives adequate prescriptions to the policy makers, educationists, literatteurs alike for the advancement and profitable use of languages particularly our Maa Boli Dogri. I have tried to make my humble contribution to dogri literature by publishing two Anthologies of dogri poems in which I have tried to explore and try new idiom, themes and varied imagery. Some of these poems definitely meet the criteria you have underlined in your article and these can be certainly taught in the educational institutions.\n\nAshok Angurana\n\nIII\n\nA well researched write-up. It not only highlights importance of Dogri language; at the same time it's incorporation in official working of the UT, in particular in Revenue, Police and Judiciary, as suggested in the write-up up, if implimented, would be a landmark step in the right direction.\n\nVarinder Gupta,\n\nTrikuta Nagar Jammu",
