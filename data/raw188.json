        "body": "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., July 26, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n\nDomestic Private Client Group net new assets(1)(2) of $14.4 billion for the fiscal third quarter, 5.4% annualized growth rate from beginning of period assetsRecord quarterly net revenues of $2.91 billion, up 7% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter and 1% over the preceding quarterQuarterly net income available to common shareholders of $369 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, and quarterly adjusted net income available to common shareholders of $399 million(3), or $1.85 per diluted share(3)Record client assets under administration of $1.28 trillion and financial assets under management of $200.7 billionNet interest income and Raymond James Bank Deposit Program (\"RJBDP\") fees from third-party banks of $708 million during the quarter, up 91% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter and down 3% compared to the preceding quarterRecord net revenues of $8.57 billion and record net income available to common shareholders of $1.30 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2023, up 5% and 22%, respectively, over the first nine months of fiscal 2022Annualized return on common equity of 17.9% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity of 22.7%(3) for the first nine months of fiscal 2023\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla - Raymond James Financial, Inc. (NYSE: RJF) today reported record net revenues of $2.91 billion and net income available to common shareholders of $369 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2023. Excluding $40 million of expenses related to acquisitions, quarterly adjusted net income available to common shareholders was $399 million(3), or $1.85 per diluted share(3).\n\nRecord quarterly net revenues increased 7% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter. The benefit of higher short-term interest rates on net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks more than offset declines in investment banking revenues, brokerage revenues, and asset management and related administrative fees. The 1% sequential increase in quarterly net revenues was primarily due to higher asset management and related administrative fees.\n\nQuarterly net income available to common shareholders increased 23% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter, driven primarily by higher net interest income and RJBDP fees from third-party banks which were partially offset by elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters. Sequentially, net income available to common shareholders decreased 13%. Quarterly results were negatively impacted by elevated provisions for legal and regulatory matters of approximately $65 million and bank loan provision for credit losses of $54 million.\n\nFor the first nine months of the fiscal year, record net revenues of $8.57 billion increased 5%, record earnings per diluted common share of $5.95 increased 19%, and adjusted earnings per diluted common share of $6.17(3) increased 14% over the first nine months of fiscal 2022. The Private Client Group segment generated record net revenues and record pre-tax income during the first nine months of the fiscal year. Annualized return on common equity was 17.9% and annualized adjusted return on tangible common equity was 22.7%(3).\n\n\"Through the strength of our businesses and perseverance of our advisors and associates, we generated record net revenues and record net income to common shareholders during the first nine months of the fiscal year, up 5% and 22%, respectively, over fiscal 2022 despite challenging macroeconomic conditions,\" said Chair and CEO Paul Reilly. \"Importantly, our strong capital ratios and flexible balance sheet keep us well-positioned as we look forward.\"\n\nSegment Results\n\nPrivate Client Group\n\nDomestic Private Client Group net new assets(1)(2) of $14.4 billion for the fiscal third quarter, 5.4% annualized growth rate from beginning of period assets Record quarterly net revenues of $2.18 billion, up 11% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter and 2% over the preceding quarterQuarterly pre-tax income of $411 million, up 64% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter and down 7% compared to the preceding quarterRecord Private Client Group assets under administration of $1.23 trillion, up 15% compared to June 2022 and 5% over March 2023Record Private Client Group assets in fee-based accounts of $697.0 billion, up 15% compared to June 2022 and 5% over March 2023Total clients' domestic cash sweep and Enhanced Savings Program (\"ESP\") balances of $58.0 billion, down 24% compared to June 2022 and up 11% over March 2023\n\nThe year-over-year growth in quarterly net revenues and pre-tax income was driven primarily by increases in RJBDP fees and net interest income, which more than offset market-driven declines in asset management and related administrative fees and brokerage revenues. Sequentially, quarterly net revenues grew 2% driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees, which were offset by a decline in RJBDP fees due to lower cash sweep balances, and lower brokerage revenues. However, quarterly pre-tax income declined 7% compared to the preceding quarter driven by higher provisions for legal and regulatory matters and seasonally higher advisor recognition events and conference expenses.\n\nTotal clients' domestic cash sweep and ESP balances grew 11% over March 2023. The increase reflects strong growth in ESP balances which more than offset a modest decline in cash sweep balances largely due to quarterly fee billings and income tax payments. Reflecting higher short-term interest rates, the average yield on RJBDP third-party bank balances increased 12 basis points to 3.37% in the fiscal third quarter.\n\n\"Financial advisor retention and recruiting are strong across our multiple affiliation options driven by our advisor and client-focused culture and leading technology and product solutions,\" said Reilly. \"For example, our recently-launched Enhanced Savings Program ended the quarter at $11.2 billion, as advisors and their clients continue to value this attractive offering.\"\n\nCapital Markets\n\nQuarterly net revenues of $276 million, down 28% compared to the prior year's fiscal third quarter and 9% compared to the preceding quarterQuarterly pre-tax loss of $34 millionQuarterly investment banking revenues of $141 million, down 35% compared to the prior year's fiscal third quarter and 3% compared to the preceding quarter\n\nThe year-over-year decline in quarterly net revenues and pre-tax income was largely attributable to lower investment banking and fixed income brokerage revenues. Compensation expense declined 9% driven by lower variable compensation, partially offset by amortization of deferred compensation and additional compensation related to growth investments.\n\n\"Investment banking activity across the industry remains muted,\" said Reilly. \"While the investment banking pipeline remains healthy and new business activity is solid, the timing of closings is largely dependent on improving market conditions.\"\n\nAsset Management\n\nQuarterly net revenues of $226 million, down 1% compared to the prior year's fiscal third quarter and up 5% over the preceding quarterQuarterly pre-tax income of $89 million, down 4% compared to the prior year's fiscal third quarter and up 9% over the preceding quarterFinancial assets under management of $200.7 billion, up 10% over June 2022 and 3% over March 2023\n\nFinancial assets under management of $200.7 billion grew 10% over the prior-year quarter and 3% over the preceding quarter. The increase in financial assets under management was primarily the result of higher equity markets, along with net inflows into fee-based accounts in the Private Client Group.\n\nBank\n\nQuarterly net revenues of $514 million, up 86% over the prior year's fiscal third quarter and down 5% compared to the preceding quarterQuarterly pre-tax income of $66 million, down 11% compared to the prior year's fiscal third quarter and 27% compared to the preceding quarterBank segment net interest margin (\"NIM\") of 3.26% for the quarter, up 85 basis points over the prior year's fiscal third quarter and down 37 basis points compared to the preceding quarterNet loans of $43.3 billion, up 4% over June 2022 and down 1% compared to March 2023\n\nQuarterly net revenues increased over the prior-year quarter driven by higher asset balances and the favorable impact from higher short-term interest rates. Sequentially, quarterly net revenues declined 5% due to lower net interest income. The Bank segment's NIM decreased 37 basis points during the quarter to 3.26%, primarily due to increased interest expense from higher-cost funding as ESP balances replaced a portion of lower-cost RJBDP client cash sweep balances. Net loans increased 4% over the prior-year quarter and declined 1% compared to the preceding quarter primarily driven by lower corporate loans. Quarterly bank loan provision for credit losses of $54 million increased over the preceding quarter primarily due to weaker macroeconomic assumptions for the Moody's CRE Price Index in the Current Expected Credit Loss (\"CECL\") model. Despite a higher provision, the credit quality of the loan portfolio is solid, with criticized loans as a percent of total loans held for investment ending the quarter at 0.94%, down from 1.63% at June 2022 and up slightly from 0.92% at March 2023. Bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans held for investment was 1.04%, and bank loan allowance for credit losses on corporate loans as a percent of corporate loans held for investment was 1.90%.\n\nOther\n\nDuring the fiscal third quarter, the firm repurchased 3.31 million shares of common stock for $300 million at an average price of $91 per share. As of July 26, 2023, approximately $750 million remained available under the Board's approved common stock repurchase authorization. At the end of the quarter, the total capital ratio was 22.0%(4) and the tier 1 leverage ratio was 11.4%(4), both well above regulatory requirements.\n\nA conference call to discuss the results will take place today, Wednesday, July 26, at 5:00 p.m. ET.

(\"Acadian\" or the \"Company\") (TSX:ADN) today reported financial and operating results1 for the three months ended June 24, 2023 (the \"second quarter\").\n\n\"While the second quarter of the year is traditionally our slowest due to seasonal operating conditions, favourable weather allowed harvest to continue later into the winter and to begin earlier after the spring thaw. Combined with increased contractor capacity, Acadian delivered strong second quarter results and recovered much of the volume shortfall of the first quarter,\" commented Adam Sheparski, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We are also pleased to announce the successful registration of our first voluntary carbon credits, which are now available for sale.\"\n\nAcadian generated $4.1 million of Free Cash Flow during the second quarter and declared dividends of $4.9 million to shareholders. Acadian's balance sheet remains solid with $17.0 million of net liquidity as at June 24, 2023, which includes funds available under our credit facilities.\n\nOn June 8, 2023, 770,071 voluntary carbon credits were registered on the American Carbon Registry and made available for sale under the project name Anew - Katahdin Forestry Project, and have been recorded as inventory in our June 24, 2023 interim condensed consolidated financial statements. These carbon credits are associated with our first carbon credit development project on the portion of our Maine Timberlands that is subject to a working forest conservation easement.\n\nThe total volume of credits expected to be generated from the project over the 10-year crediting period has increased from the initial estimate of 1.6 million credits to 1.9 million credits. Actual credit issuances will be adjusted each reporting period based on actual harvesting, natural disturbances, and other factors, as well as periodic updating for inventory and verification activities.\n\nAcadian is committed to health and safety as our number one priority. We believe that emphasizing and achieving a good safety performance is a leading indicator of success in the broader business. Acadian's operations experienced no recordable safety incidents during the quarter among employees or contractors.\n\n1 This news release makes reference to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Free Cash Flow and Payout Ratios which are key performance measures in evaluating Acadian's operations and are important in enhancing investors' understanding of the Company's operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are indicative of the underlying profitability of Acadian's operating segments and are used to evaluate operational performance. Free Cash Flow is used to evaluate Acadian's ability to generate sustainable cash flows from our operations while Payout Ratios are used to evaluate Acadian's ability to fund its distribution using Free Cash Flow. Acadian's management defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, fair value adjustments, recovery of or impairment of land and roads and depreciation and amortization, and \"Adjusted EBITDA margin\" as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Acadian's sales. Free Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less interest paid, current income tax expense, and capital expenditures plus net proceeds from the sale of timberlands and other fixed assets (proceeds less gains or losses). Reference made to \"Payout Ratio\" is defined as dividends declared divided by Free Cash Flow, and Payout Ratio with DRIP is defined as dividends paid in cash divided by Free Cash Flow. We have provided in this news release reconciliations of net income, as determined in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), to Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. Reference is also made to net liquidity which includes cash and funds available under credit facilities less amounts reserved to support the minimum cash balance related to long-term debt. As these measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS, they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Please refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis for further details.\n\nReview of Operations\n\nFinancial and Operating Highlights\n\nThree Months EndedSix Months Ended(CAD thousands, except per share information)June 24, 2023 June 25, 2022June 24, 2023June 25, 2022Sales volume (000s m3) 184.2 156.7 389.4 457.9Sales$20,707$ 16,493$43,069$ 43,124Operating income 5,217 2,684 10,521 9,522Net income 5,813 4,516 11,433 8,674Adjusted EBITDA$5,651$ 2,747$11,252$ 9,656Adjusted EBITDA margin 27% 17% 26% 22%Free Cash Flow$4,108$ 1,877$7,831$ 6,891Dividends declared 4,940 4,856 9,859 9,695Dividends paid in cash 3,724 3,713 7,445 8,552Payout Ration/an/a 126% 141%Payout Ratio with DRIPn/an/a 95% 124%Per share - basic and diluted Net income$0.34$ 0.27$0.67$ 0.52Free Cash Flow 0.24 0.11 0.46 0.41Dividends declared 0.29 0.29 0.58 0.58\n\nDuring the second quarter, Acadian generated sales of $20.7 million, compared to $16.5 million in the prior year period. The weighted average selling price, excluding biomass, increased 9% year-over-year, benefiting from strong softwood sawlog and hardwood pulpwood prices driven by strong demand.\n\nSales volume, excluding biomass, was 18% higher compared to the prior year period as a result of favourable weather, which allowed harvest to continue later into the winter and to begin earlier after the spring thaw, and increased contractor availability. Biomass sales volume was 8% higher due to favourable market conditions.\n\nOperating costs and expenses were $15.5 million during the second quarter, compared to $13.8 million during the prior year period, reflecting higher sales volumes. Weighted average variable costs, excluding biomass, were 10% lower as compared to the prior year period, primarily as a result of lower fuel costs and shorter hauling distances, partially offset by increased contractor rates.\n\nNet income for the second quarter totaled $5.8 million, or $0.34 per share, compared to $4.5 million, or $0.27 per share, in the same period of 2022. The increase in net income compared to the prior year period was primarily the result of higher operating income and gain on the sale of 16 acres of timberlands, partially offset by lower non-cash fair value adjustments.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $5.7 million during the second quarter compared to $2.7 million in the prior year period, reflecting higher operating income and gain on sale of timberlands. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 27% compared to 17% in the prior year period. Free Cash Flow was $4.1 million, being $2.2 million higher than the prior year period.\n\nDuring the first half of 2023, Acadian generated sales of $43.1 million, consistent with the prior year period. Sales volume, excluding biomass, was 18% lower than the first half of 2022 but was offset by a 13% increase in the weighted average selling price, excluding biomass. Operating costs and expenses of $32.5 million were $1.1 million lower year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA of $11.3 million was $1.6 million higher compared to the prior year period.\n\nFor the six months ended June 24, 2023, net income was $11.4 million, or $0.67 per share, which represents an increase of $2.7 million compared to the prior year period, primarily the result of higher operating income, gain on sale of timberlands and non-cash fair value adjustments.\n\nSegment Performance\n\nNew Brunswick Timberlands\n\nThe table below summarizes operating and financial results for New Brunswick Timberlands.\n\nThree Months EndedSix Months Ended June 24, 2023June 25, 2022June 24, 2023June 25, 2022Harvest (000s m3) Softwood 58.6 48.3 145.5 176.4Hardwood 47.2 42.5 109.4 110.7Biomass - 3.5 25.8 29.5Total 105.8 94.3 280.7 316.6Sales (000s m3) Softwood 60.2 55.7 145.3 181.3Hardwood 80.2 64.0 124.4 115.8Biomass 7.1 3.5 32.9 29.5Total 147.5 123.2 302.6 326.6Sales Mix Softwood 41% 45% 48% 56%Hardwood 54% 52% 41% 35%Biomass 5% 3% 11% 9%Total 100% 100% 100% 100%Results ($000s) Softwood $4,238$4,023$10,486$12,197Hardwood 7,899 5,641 12,760 10,146Biomass 320 152 1,630 1,308Total $12,457$9,816$24,876$23,651Timber services and other 4,112 3,728 9,600 7,902Sales $16,569$13,544$34,476$31,553Adjusted EBITDA $4,996$2,710$9,879$7,378Adjusted EBITDA margin 30% 20% 29% 23%\n\nSales for New Brunswick Timberlands in the second quarter were $16.6 million compared to $13.5 million during the prior year period. Sales volume, excluding biomass, increased by 17% primarily due to favourable weather conditions compared to the second quarter of the prior year and increased contractor availability. Biomass sales volume increased by 98% as compared to the prior year period due to favourable market conditions.\n\nThe weighted average selling price, excluding biomass, for the second quarter was $86.36 per m3, or 7% higher than the prior year period, as a result of stable softwood sawlog and pulpwood prices, driven by strong demand, partially offset by lower hardwood sawlog pricing due to unfavourable end use markets. Biomass prices were 7% higher year-over-year due to favourable market conditions.\n\nOperating costs and expenses were $11.9 million during the second quarter, compared to $10.9 million in the prior year period, reflecting higher sales volumes. Weighted average variable costs, excluding biomass, were 15% lower primarily as a result of lower fuel costs and shorter hauling distances, partially offset by increased contractor rates.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $5.0 million compared to $2.7 million in the prior year period and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30% compared to 20% in the prior year period as a result of higher operating income.\n\nDuring the first half of 2023, New Brunswick Timberlands' sales of $34.5 million were 9% higher than the prior year period. The weighted average selling price, excluding biomass, increased 15%, however, sales volume, excluding biomass, decreased 9% year-over-year due to contractor availability noted previously. Operating costs and expenses of $25.2 million during the first half of 2023 were $0.9 million higher than the prior year period, due primarily to increased contractor rates. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.9 million compared to $7.4 million in the first half of 2022, and Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 29% from 23%.\n\nMaine Timberlands\n\nThe table below summarizes operating and financial results for Maine Timberlands.\n\nThree Months EndedSix Months Ended June 24, 2023June 25, 2022June 24, 2023June 25, 2022Harvest (000s m3) Softwood 27.7 19.5 57.0 96.6Hardwood 10.7 5.4 26.2 27.7Biomass - 3.0 6.5 3.2Total 38.4 27.9 89.7 127.5Sales (000s m3) Softwood 24.0 19.7 52.2 96.6Hardwood 12.7 10.8 28.1 31.5Biomass - 3.0 6.5 3.2Total 36.7 33.5 86.8 131.3Sales Mix Softwood 65% 59% 60% 74%Hardwood 35% 32% 32% 24%Biomass - 9% 8% 2%Total 100% 100% 100% 100%Results ($000s) Softwood $2,737$ 1,662$5,373$ 8,449Hardwood 1,182 1,127 2,734 2,853Biomass - 6 60 10Total $3,919$ 2,795$8,167$ 11,312Timber services and other 219 154 426 259Sales $ 4,138$ 2,949$8,593$ 11,571Adjusted EBITDA $1,133$ 364$2,232$ 3,116Adjusted EBITDA margin 27% 12% 26% 27%\n\nSales for Maine Timberlands during the second quarter totaled $4.1 million compared to $2.9 million in the prior year period. Sales volume, excluding biomass, increased 20% reflecting an earlier start to operations and increased contractor availability, as compared to the same period in the prior year.\n\nIn U.S dollar terms, the weighted average selling price, excluding biomass, was $79.55 per m3, compared to $71.39 per m3 during the same period of 2022, driven primarily by higher softwood sawlog prices benefiting from favourable market dynamics. The weighted average selling price, excluding biomass, in Canadian dollar terms was $106.92 per m3, compared to $91.13 per m3 during the same period of 2022, being further impacted by foreign exchange rates.\n\nOperating costs and expenses for the second quarter were $3.1 million, compared to $2.6 million during the same period in 2022, reflecting higher harvesting activity. Weighted average variable costs, excluding biomass, increased 5% primarily as a result of higher contractor rates.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $1.1 million compared to $0.4 million in the prior year period and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 27%, up from 12% in the prior year period.\n\nDuring the first half of 2023, Maine Timberlands' sales were $8.6 million compared to $11.6 million in the first half of 2022. Maine Timberlands' weighted average selling price, excluding biomass, increased 14% in Canadian dollar terms, and 8% in U.S. dollar terms, however sales volume, excluding biomass, was 37% lower. Operating costs and expenses of $6.5 million during the first half of 2023 were $2.0 million lower than the prior year period, as a result of lower harvesting activity partially offset by higher contractor rates.\n\nOutlook\n\nNorth American inflation concerns persist, and interest rates continue to increase, which has put near-term pressure on end use markets. However, we remain confident that the stability of the northeastern forestry sector, combined with the long-term demand for new homes and repair and remodel activity, will support the demand for our products. Consensus forecast for U.S. housing starts has risen to approximately 1.37 million starts in 2023.\n\nWe experienced increased contractor availability during the second quarter and expect to maintain this capacity throughout the remainder of the year. Inflation continues to impact our financial results through elevated contractor rates and fuel surcharges.\n\nDemand for Acadian's sawlogs is mainly driven by regional supply and demand, meaning that the stable demand experienced in the first half of 2023 is expected to continue. Pricing for softwood sawtimber is expected to remain stable, however, pricing for hardwood sawtimber may weaken, reflecting the recent weakness in hardwood lumber pricing. While regional inventories of hardwood pulpwood have been replenished and demand has begun to slow, this market is expected to remain stable. Softwood pulpwood markets are expected to remain at the improved levels experienced in 2022.\n\nQuarterly Dividend\n\nBased on a strong balance sheet and outlook for the remainder of the year, Acadian is pleased to announce a dividend of $0.29 per share, payable on October 15, 2023 to shareholders of record on September 30, 2023.\n\nAcadian Timber Corp. is one of the largest timberland owners in Eastern Canada and the Northeastern U.S. and has a total of approximately 2.4 million acres of land under management. Acadian owns and manages approximately 761,000 acres of freehold timberlands in New Brunswick, approximately 300,000 acres of freehold timberlands in Maine and provides timber services relating to approximately 1.3 million acres of Crown licensed timberlands in New Brunswick. Acadian's products include softwood and hardwood sawlogs, pulpwood and biomass by-products, sold to approximately 90 regional customers.\n\nAcadian's business strategy is to maximize cash flows from its existing timberland assets through sustainable forest management and other land use activities while growing its business by acquiring assets and actively managing these assets to drive improved performance.\n\nAcadian's shares are listed for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol ADN.\n\nFor further information, please visit our website at www.acadiantimber.com or contact:\n\nSusan Wood\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nTel: 506-737-2345\n\nEmail: ir@acadiantimber.com\n\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information and Statements\n\nThis News Release contains forward-looking information and statements within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Acadian Timber Corp. and its subsidiaries (collectively, \"Acadian\"), or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

        "body": "On a daily basis, as international flights arrive the airport, it has become a recurrent decimal to see many passengers having landed safely at the airport use all manner of unprintable words to express how disgusting they are with the dilapidated infrastructures scattered all over the airport\n\nIn the recent past, so many Nigerians particularly those in the diaspora who formed the major bulk of air travellers coming from different parts of the world through the Murtala Muhamed International airport, Lagos have continued to express disappointment at the infrastructural decay adorning the number one gateway airport in the country.\n\nOn a daily basis, as international flights arrive the airport, it has become a recurrent decimal to see many passengers having landed safely at the airport use all manner of unprintable words to express how disgusting they are with the dilapidated infrastructures scattered all over the airport.\n\nFor travellers flying into the Lagos airport from places like Europe, America or Middle East, the first horror awaiting them is the stench that oozes out of the old and unkempt toilets therein which do not befit the status of any international airport even at smaller airports in neighbouring countries.\n\nRelated Posts Law establishing institute for environmental practitioners gazette Common herbal tonic for pain in pregnancy contributes to male infertility -- Study Adoption and your emotional well-being (1)\n\nBesides the defaced toilets lacking essential needs like tissue papers, air fresheners and soaps, many of the WC toilet systems installed there have changed colour due to old age and overuse.\n\nApart from the stress you will be made to pass through in the hands of the immigration officials who may keep you standing on the queue for the same hours it takes you to fly for example from places like London to Lagos to have your passport stamped, more troubles await you in the hands of the other different uniform personnel whose major aim is to exploit you.\n\nIf you manage to pass through these hurdles, God help you if you are not faced with bigger problems as you walk to the baggage claim area where you can be subjected to a fresh hassles of having to wait endlessly for the carousel to bring your luggage out.\n\nAt times, owing to the over flogging of the carousel otherwise known as conveyor belt, count yourself lucky if you are able to collect your luggage without it breaking down midway due to over usage.\n\nIn other climes, an international airport like the MMIA should have alternative carousels that can conveniently handle passengers luggage particularly during the peak periods when there may likely be multiple flights landing at the same time.\n\nEven the cooling systems that cost Nigeria several millions of naira to install are not faring better especially towards evening when most foreign carriers come in to pick their passengers out of the country as passengers sweat profusely while they await their flights.\n\nSometimes, it's either the entire environment suddenly goes into darkness or the essential areas at the peak of passengers' profiling due to obsolete cables some of which were installed as far back as 1979 when the Lagos airport was built after the Schiphol airport which has been rebuilt many times by the Dutch government.\n\nThe problems of the deplorable state of the number one gateway airport have remained a rocket science for the subsequent ministers of aviation to resolve despite the huge funds often allocated to the sector to address infrastructural deficits.\n\nFor any traveller landing at the Lagos airport for the first time, the number one thing to observe is an archaic structure housing both the arrival and departure terminals adorned with old facilities that have been overflogged due to many years of existence.\n\nMany Nigerians including air travelers had described the status of the Lagos airport as a national disgrace in view of the unpleasant attendant pains it brings to seamless air transport.\n\nLittle wonder how, in the recent past, passengers have been bombarding the different social media spaces with tales of their experiences on landing or departing the country through the airport.\n\nMany of the aggrieved passengers who have complained that they are not getting the value for the huge funds they pay, lamented that the kind of outdated facilities adorning the airport were not commensurate to what they pay for their tickets and other services.\n\nA passenger with the social media handle @o_aisien once exclaimed at what she witnessed at the airport saying: \"I was ashamed to say the least. Experts flying into Nigeria and this is what greets them? It's appalling, the aviation minister should be held accountable@faanofficial@jidesanwoolu\".\n\nAnother passenger with the twitter handle @lolashoneyin gave an embarrassing details of what she saw at the Lagos international airport when she saw off her relative travelling out through the airport when she narrated how she saw bowls of different sizes spread on the floor to collect rains water dropping from the leaking roofs.\n\nDescribing the Lagos airport as a place of shame for all Nigerians as a people even as she declared that the shenanigans going on there defy any logical explanations, the airport user remarked: \"Is there or are there some people actually paid to manage this airport? Are they guided by any KPI ? I understand that they may be incapacitated by financing and all sorts of vested interests, but there are some minimum things like keeping order and keeping the place safe and clean, that they can at least do.\n\nI saw a relative off to the airport and right from the door, passing through the screening machine, the agency staff on duty were too busy trying to see who or how they could fleece passengers coming in, that you could carry any dangerous weapons through them and they won't notice.\n\nThe entire place is run down, the check-in counters are all broken down, worn, the counter tops, tables are falling apart, the conveyor belts that are supposed take the luggage away to the aircraft are broken down and so they cart the luggage away in some kind of trolley.\n\nThe toilets are an eyesore! The water cisterns are broken, the toilet roll holders and toilet rolls don't exist. You will see the cleaner holding the toilet roll though, and they greet effusively so you understand you have to drop something for the use of the t/roll.\n\nPassing through on another occasion, the arrival hall was worse, a passenger's nightmare. The luggage carousels are worn, some of the flabs are half torn off, even the part constructed during Stella Oduah's time as minister was so badly done that everything is already falling apart. It was definitely not done by anyone with requisite skills or exposure to work on a project of that class or scope.\n\nNow, let's talk about the jetway, what a shame, It is either dripping water all over the place when it's raining or it's so dark because the bulbs or fluorescent have all burnt out and passengers just have to manage and grope in the dark with whatever little light is available and then try to dodge the puddles of water on the jetway floor.\n\nThe pre boarding areas of some gates also don't have working florescent or bulb and so the whole place is dark and dingy looking.\n\nAre there people paid every month to run the airport. Do they have an engineering department that sees to daily maintenance, faulty bulbs, bad luggage carousels, leaky roofs, bad toilet faucet etc?!Or are passengers just at the mercy of the Nigerian system.\n\nThe entire departure hall was so filthy and there was not a single cleaner in sight, cleaning, as you would find in other airports across the world. It was so filthy that I cannot compare it to anything I've seen anywhere else.\"\n\nThe lamentation of this airport user which captures the daily bad experiences suffered by travellers at the airport however puts question marks on some of the past ministers of aviation that had been put in charge of managing the airports.\n\nA Canada bound passenger who spoke to Tribune while awaiting his flight on Wednesday, expressed disgust for the state of the airport.\n\nIn conclusion, he said if nothing is done to fix the deficits that passengers may, one of these days, initiate what he called a class suit action against the Nigerian government for failing to justify the huge funds they pay through the taxes taken from them on the tickets they purchase.\n\nReactions aviation key players:\n\nFor the immediate past President of Aviation Safety Round Table (ASRT), Dr Gabriel Olowo, the Lagos international airport is a national disgrace and therefore, called for the immediate stripping or pulling down of the facility and rebuilding another one.\n\nAccording to him; \"Murtala Muhammed International Airport, which is Nigeria's number one airport built in 1978, should be shut down, stripped 100 percent and rebuilt. It remains a national disgrace and an eyesore when speaking about the world's contemporary modern airports. Fingers A, B and C as in the original masterplan should be added like yesterday. Aerotropolis can then come to compliment the aerotropolis.\"\n\nFor one of the leading labour leaders in the sector' Comrade OlayinkaAbioye, the Lagos international airport requires a complete rehabilitation \"as if we are building a new airport. No matter the repair that is carried out, it will be wasted resources.\n\nThere is hardly any part of that building that is not sick and require surgical emergency.\n\n\"So, my take is rather than pull down the entire structure, we need to do it phase by phase. Start from one wing of the terminal, dismantle all that are dismantleable and fix them. Afterwards, start from another wing and within one year, we shall be good to go. For security reasons I will refrain from saying some things but we need a holistic approach in dealing with MMIA.\"\n\nDeplorable Lagos airport blamed on corruption:\n\nTo show their anger, many stakeholders have blamed the deplorable structures at the airport on the alleged corruption perpetrated by of many of the previous ministers. According to a former military commandant of the airport, Group Captain John Ojikutu (retired), \"That airpot alone generates minimum of 50% of the total FAAN annual earnings, unfortunately, institutional corruptions have been on the way against the periodic maintenance of the infrastructure and the facilities.\"\n\nIt is on record that among the ministers that had been appointed to manage the sector, the one that graciously have more than enough access to funds, part of which could have been used to fix the infrastructural deficit but ignored it was the immediate past minister, Senator HadiSirika.\n\nSirika rather than use part of the huge funds allocated to his ministry to fix the critical aspects of the airport failing structures, concentrated on unnecessary projects such as the national carrier and airports concession.\n\nThe previous ministers that came before Sirika also failed in this aspect as they came and left the infrastructures at the Lagos airport and other major international airports unattended to. The only one that tried a bit was Stella Oduah through her airport remodeling policy.\n\nTo many key players, there is no way the number one gateway airport should be in this mess in view of the fact that the airport alone generate minimum of 50 percent of the total FAAN annual earnings.\n\nAt the rate the facilities at the airport breaks down, many airport users are of the opinion that if the President Bola Ahmed Tinubu government through the National Assembly fails to declare state of emergency at the Lagos airport and most others across the country, Nigerians may wake one day to see that the entire structure built in 1979 has caved in leaving the country with the alternative new terminal commissioned over a year ago but sadly with structural error which has made it unattractive to foreign airlines.\n\nAccording to some airport workers who spoke to Aviation Tribune, if the government fails to fix the dilapidated structures, this may force passengers particularly the international ones from shunning the Lagos airport which may drastically affect the revenue generation of FAAN and subsequently rubbish all efforts to make the Lagos airport a hub for the region.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 Nigerian Tribune Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

        "body": "Buoyant lettings activity in the UK capital's tight rental market boosted earnings at London-based estate agency Foxtons, offsetting a slowdown in house sales in the first half of the year.\n\nFoxtons posted pre-tax profits of \u00a36.1mn in the six months to the end of June, up from \u00a34.3mn a year earlier. Lettings revenue rose 26 per cent in the same period, offsetting a 19 per cent drop in sales revenue caused by higher mortgage costs.\n\nThe agency, which has more than 27,000 tenancies, said on Thursday it expected \"little change\" to the \"supply and demand imbalance\" that had driven up rent in London, but expected the pace of rent rises to cool in the second half of the year.\n\nIntense competition for a reduced pool of London homes has accelerated as interest rates have risen, while soaring borrowing costs have hit demand from buyers and sellers.\n\n\"The continued growth in the imbalance between supply and demand is at the highest levels we have ever seen,\" Foxtons said. \"This continues to drive rents and is making it more difficult for renters to find affordable accommodation in London.\"\n\nFoxtons has in the last year sought to increase its activity in the rental market, which it sees as more resilient to economic downturns than sales. Lettings made up 70 per cent of the estate agent's revenue in the first half of the year, compared with 61 per cent in 2022.\n\n\"Our continued focus on growing non-cyclical and recurring revenues is working and has enabled us to deliver strong revenue and profit growth despite a challenging sales market,\" said chief executive Guy Gittins.\n\nThe group said it had received fewer buyer inquiries in July because of the rising cost of borrowing. Mortgage rates, which had been climbing in recent months, soared after the Bank of England raised its benchmark interest rate to 5 per cent in June.\n\nFoxtons, which was founded in the 1980s in London, said mortgage refinancing volumes jumped 29 per cent in the first half and it expected the trend to continue throughout the year. However, overall revenue at its financial services business fell 12 per cent as customers took smaller loans and made fewer new purchases.\n\nFoxtons said that although it expected an increase in house sales in the third quarter, inflation and high borrowing costs would continue to hit transactions throughout the year.\n\nThe group's board announced a half-year dividend of 0.2p a share. Shares in the agency rose 3 per cent in early trading on Thursday.",

        "body": "A general view of the Egyptian stock exchange in Cairo August 18, 2013. Egypt's stock market fell sharply on Sunday as it resumed trading after hundreds of people were killed in a crackdown by the army-backed government on supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood. Banks and the stock market reopened for the first time since Wednesday's carnage, with shares rapidly falling 2.5 percent. REUTERS/Louafi Larbi (EGYPT - Tags: POLITICS CIVIL UNREST BUSINESS)\n\nThe Egyptian Exchange (EGX) decided Wednesday to stop the EGX50 EWI index, as of 1 August.\n\nWithin the framework of the Egyptian Exchange's direction towards permanent updating and continuous development of market indicators to ensure the diversification of tools for measuring market performance in front of different categories of investors, and within the framework of continuous review of current market indicators and studying the components of each of them and the extent of its uniqueness and uniqueness of its methodology from other indicators and studying the extent to which all elements of the market benefit out of every index, the Egyptian Exchange saw that the EGX50 EWI index is the least used.\n\nThe Egyptian Exchange - desiring to know the opinion of all market elements - conducted an opinion poll for a group of 17 investment research centers, asset management companies and investment funds. It was clear from the results of the survey that the EGX50 EWI index is one of the least used indicators The survey revealed that they rarely use the index data or do not use it at all, at a rate of 94%, and most of them saw that it is the most appropriate index that the Egyptian Exchange can stop working with.",

        "title": "How to bridge data silos and enable cloud-like efficiency",
        "body": "Sponsored Feature Modern business decisions rely on intelligent data rather than assumptions. To make informed operational and business choices, organizations amass and store vast amounts of data.\n\nData-driven insights can significantly benefit supply chain management, resource allocation, process optimization, and understanding customer preferences. Personalized business experiences are now expected by 71 percent of consumers, and leveraging valuable data insights can meet this demand. Studies indicate that enhancing the customer experience can boost sales revenues by 2-7 percent and profitability by 1-2 percent.\n\nHowever, businesses struggle to unify data into a single source of truth. Many organizations face challenges in establishing innovative, data-driven processes.\n\nA recent Statista survey of 116 businesses worldwide reveals that many firms still struggle to establish innovative, data-driven organizations. This becomes problematic as digital transformations proceed without sufficient data intelligence. Data silos, inadequate infrastructure to handle growing data volumes, and unstructured data impede the unlocking of data's full potential.\n\nThe exponential growth of data, estimated to be twice as large by 2025, further compounds the issue. Merely collecting and storing data is insufficient; the real challenge lies in extracting meaningful insights for strategic decision-making.\n\nCommon hurdles in unlocking data value and intelligence include:\n\n- Multiple data silos: Silos obstruct data availability and value, necessitating their dismantling to facilitate data access, security, sharing, and collaboration.\n\n- Inadequate infrastructure for high data volumes: Existing on-premises infrastructure may lack the processing power and storage capacity required. Moving resources to the cloud is an option, but it can be costly and complex. Hybrid solutions have gained popularity.\n\n- Unstructured data: Scattered across various locations and formats, unstructured data is difficult to integrate, organize, analyze, and gain insights from.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a robust data management solution that aggregates data from silos, offers valuable insights regardless of storage location, and automates processes using AI. Let's explore how Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) GreenLake provides such a solution.\n\nWave goodbye to data silos\n\nHPE GreenLake, an edge-to-cloud platform, enables data-first modernization through various services. By integrating existing infrastructures with cloud resources, organizations can adopt a cloud-like experience without full migration. The platform allows businesses to maximize their edge investments while capitalizing on cloud scalability, agility, and innovation.\n\nThe platform also analyzes data wherever it resides, to address cost and complexity concerns associated with sending, storing, and analyzing data in the cloud. It eliminates data silos and empowers organizations to extract real-time insights from their operations, delivering a holistic view of their data-driven insights.\n\nWith this approach, companies can also apply the same data management policies, rules and deployments across their on-premise and cloud environments with minimal overhead.\n\nOffered on a self-service, pay-as-you-go model, HPE GreenLake provides businesses with control over accessing and consuming services. The automated self-service functionality enables provisioning, configuration, and management of IT resources according to specific requirements.\n\nThe pay-as-you-go model eliminates upfront capital expenditures, allowing businesses to scale resources based on demand and align IT spending with operational needs.\n\nHPE GreenLake gives customers the opportunity to get a true picture of activities across their hybrid estate by offering an analytics dashboard that can display key features, such as consumption analytics, continuous regulatory compliance monitoring, and fast provisioning.\n\n\"Businesses now have the opportunity to use the HPE GreenLake Cloud Portal (GLCP), which is designed to harmonize all the assets owned by a company into a single pane, which can be fed over time into an analytics backend, allowing businesses to have an overview of how their data is performing,\" says Williams.\n\nSeveral case studies highlight how HPE GreenLake adoption has helped companies sustain business growth through data intelligence.\n\nIn summary, data is a valuable resource, but its true worth lies in the insights it provides. HPE GreenLake aims to bridge data silos and enable cloud-like efficiency within on-premises infrastructure. By maintaining control, governance, security, and familiarity, organizations can achieve data-first business transformation.",

        "title": "How SHEIN Uses Global Footprint to Drive Local Impact",
        "body": "(BPT) - While SHEIN may be synonymous with affordable online shopping, local shoppers in Indianapolis were recently treated to a first-hand look at the brand's products through a 4-day pop-up event. Customers browsed the physical retail space, interacting with exclusive SHEIN products they would typically only be able to shop online. In the past year, SHEIN has hosted multiple pop-ups around the world.\n\nConnecting with local communities is an integral part of the online brand's strategy. For a company as large and globally connected as SHEIN, it's vital to use that market power for the greater good of the fashion industry as a whole and invest in the communities that customers and creators call home.\n\nIn May 2023, SHEIN formed a partnership with Girls Inc. of Greater Indianapolis, the central Indiana chapter of the nationwide non-profit organization. Girls Inc. Indy empowers girls, from ages 6 to 24, with evidence-based programming to support their whole selves, providing guidance and mentorship to nurture their strengths. SHEIN partnered with Girls Inc. Indy to support their 2023 STEM summer camp, an educational program for local high school girls to broaden their horizons in science, technology, engineering and math. SHEIN team members presented on multiple STEM disciplines, showing the campers a glimpse of the wide breadth of STEM careers they could pursue.\n\nParticipants of the Girls Inc. Indy program were invited to SHEIN's pop-up activation in Indianapolis, joining 3,500 fans, all able to shop various collections from the brand. Local designer Tendai Phillips also made a special appearance at the event. Originally from Zimbabwe, Phillips moved to the U.S. and earned her degree from The Art Institute of Indianapolis. Her collection, SHEIN x Redefinition, is part of the SHEIN X Design Incubator program that gives independent designers and artists around the world the tools they need to share their brand with customers across global markets. \"SHEIN X changed my future in the fashion industry by giving me a platform where I could express my creativity and share it with the rest of the world,\" explained Phillips. \"This is something that would have taken me time to build and bridge that gap between my brand and the rest of the world.\"\n\nSince kicking off SHEIN X in January 2021, SHEIN has invested over $55 million in the program and brought over 3,000 designers' original collections to market. More than half of SHEIN X designers are based in the U.S., spread across 47 states. SHEIN X designers receive production, distribution, and marketing support to take their designs from paper to the global SHEIN site. Programs like this are vital to ensure the next generation of talent has the best tools at their disposal to be successful in the industry.\n\nWhile the fashion industry continues to quickly evolve, it's exciting to see a large global brand, like SHEIN, keep individual communities at the heart of their impact. By localizing operations, including the recent establishment of facilities in locations like Brazil, SHEIN helps prove that it's possible to prioritize supporting local communities that are passionate about fashion to bring the newest trends to local customers and support designers in developing tomorrow's favorites.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

        "body": "Luxury Real Estate: Maintaining a strong sales momentum, the luxury housing segment in India registered a 130 per cent y-o-y surge across top-7 cities during the January-June 2023 period. The total sales of luxury housing units during the period stood at 6,900, compared with 3,000 units during the year-ago period, according to a report by real estate consultant CBRE South Asia.\n\nIn terms of sales, Delhi-NCR topped with sales of 2,900-unit, marking a 205 per cent Y-o-Y increase, followed by Mumbai, which recorded sales of 1,900-units, an 18 per cent Y-o-Y growth\n\n\"Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, and Hyderabad emerged as prominent markets, combined together accounting for nearly 90 per cent of the total luxury housing sales across top-7 cities,\" CBRE said in the report, titled 'India Market Monitor Q2 2023'.\n\nIt added that Hyderabad recorded the highest percentage increase in sales on a Y-o-Y basis during January-June 2023, with nearly 14-fold growth with total sales of 1,400 units. This was followed by a nearly six-fold increase in sales in Pune and over three-fold jump in Delhi-NCR on a y-o-y basis.\n\n\"In terms of the quantum of sales of luxury residential units, Delhi-NCR topped with sales of 2,900-unit, marking a 205 per cent Y-o-Y increase; followed by Mumbai, which recorded sales of 1,900-units, an 18 per cent Y-o-Y growth; while sales in Kolkata stood at 200 units, a 100 per cent Y-o-Y increase; and Pune recorded sale of 300-units, registering a 500 per cent Y-o-Y increase during this period,\" CBRE said in the report.\n\nA similar trend prevailed during the April-June 2023 quarter in the luxury housing segment across the top cities registering a 121 per cent y-o-y increase in sales. The quarter saw total sales of 3,100 luxury housing units, compared with 1,400 units during the same quarter last year.\n\nAmong the cities, Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, and Hyderabad emerged as prominent markets during the quarter, while luxury sales in Hyderabad increased by 20 times, it jumped three-fold in Delhi-NCR.\n\n\"The surge in demand for luxury housing was primarily driven by a growing preference for enhanced amenities and more spacious living areas. Moreover, it is the aspirational class that has been on an upward trend and driving luxury sales. Besides, the rise in NRI investments in the Indian real estate market has significantly contributed to the heightened demand for luxury properties,\" it said.\n\nOverall, in the residential sector, during January-June 2023 period, a total of 154,000 units were sold, and over 151,000 new units were launched across all categories. During the January-June 2023 period, sales increased by about 3 per cent compared to the same period a year ago, whereas new launches recorded a growth of 9 per cent y-o-y basis, highlighting a substantial rise in the newly launched residential properties compared to the corresponding period in the previous year.\n\nAnshuman Magazine, chairman and CEO (India, South-East Asia, Middle East & Africa) of CBRE, said, \"We are witnessing an impressive growth and resilience of the luxury housing segment, as evident from the data showing a remarkable 130 per cent increase in sales. This surge signifies the strong demand and positive momentum in the luxury housing market. Looking ahead, we anticipate a stronger second half of 2023 in the residential market, supported by factors such as a healthy supply pipeline, the approaching festive season, and stabilising mortgage rates.\"\n\nHe added that despite global macroeconomic challenges, the residential sector is expected to maintain robust sales momentum. Additionally, the premium and luxury segments are expected to perform well with new launches, and the volatility in mortgage rates on demand in this segment is anticipated to be limited.",

The 2-year Treasury yield was less than one basis point higher at 4.8308%.\n\nYields and prices move in opposite directions and one basis point equal 0.01%.\n\nInvestors weighed what could be next for interest rates and the U.S. economy after the Fed announced a further 25 basis point rate hike on Wednesday after its latest meeting ended.\n\nIn a press conference on Wednesday, Powell said there was a possibility of both further rate hikes and holding rates at the current level when policymakers next meet in September. He added that these decisions would continue to be data-dependent.\n\n\"We're going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting,\" Powell said.\n\nMany investors have been hoping that the Fed will end its rate-hiking campaign soon as concerns about elevated rates leading the U.S. economy into a recession have taken hold.\n\nThe central bank chief on Wednesday also addressed the outlook for inflation, indicating that despite easing pressures from rising prices, there's still \"a long way to go\" before inflation returns to the Fed's 2% target.\n\nThe last consumer price index print came in at 3% on an annual basis. Investors will get fresh insights on Friday, when the personal consumption expenditures price index for June is due.\n\nOn Thursday, a preliminary reading of the gross domestic product for the second quarter is expected, as are June's durable goods orders and home sales figures and the latest weekly initial jobless claims data.\n\nElsewhere, the European Central Bank is due to announce an interest rate decision on Thursday, with markets anticipating another rate hike.",

The unveiling of this special stamp reinforces ITC's commitment to promoting the sustainable cultivation and consumption of millets in everyday foods, as the initiative not only supports the environment but also provides nutritious food options for the people of India.\n\nMillets are a diverse group of small-seeded grains, including sorghum, pearl millet, finger millet, foxtail millet, and others, which have been cultivated for thousands of years and play a vital role in the diets of many communities worldwide. The International Year of Millets 2023, declared by the United Nations, marks a crucial milestone in recognizing the value of millets as a key solution to several pressing global challenges.\n\nThis initiative aims to raise awareness about the unique attributes of millets and their immense potential to contribute to food security, nutrition, and sustainable agriculture.\n\nBy promoting millets as part of a balanced diet, the International Year of Millets seeks to address malnutrition and enhance food and nutrition security worldwide. During this special year, countries are encouraged to implement policies and initiatives that support millets' production, processing, marketing, and consumption.\n\nITC have been empowering farmers with knowledge of soil, crop, and farming techniques, and assisting them in achieving better production, thus enhancing their livelihoods.

The 'Shree Anna' stamp brings to life the importance of millets in both agriculture and food.\n\nThe stamp features captivating sketch illustrations that showcase ITC Ltd.'s dedication to promote the cultivation & consumption of millets. It beautifully captures the journey of millets from Indian farms to ITC's food production factories, where they are transformed into nutritious dishes prepared by expert chefs from ITC Hotels.\n\nThe earthy colours used in the illustrations are inspired by Mission Millets logo, symbolizing millets as the golden crop of India. The stamp also highlights the Government of India's focus on nutrition and its seven guiding principles for the Indian Millets Mission 2023, celebrating the International Year of Millets. To emphasize this connection, the stamp design thoughtfully incorporates the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav logo.\n\nConnecting Agriculture, Food and Heritage\n\nThe 'Shree Anna' stamp stands out as a truly distinctive initiative that celebrates the significance of millets in both agriculture and food, while also incorporating the heritage of the country.\n\nYou can also show your support for millet revolution in India by owning a piece of history, the limited-edition digital collective stamps.

The travel ban was announced on Thursday in a Facebook post from the Ocean Affairs Council Minister Kuan Bi-ling (\u7ba1\u78a7\u73b2).\n\nThe container ship, known as the Angel, sank while anchored near the port of Kaohsiung for unknown reasons on July 20, and all 19 crew members were able to abandon the ship. The Taiwan International Ports Corporation (TIPC) stated that oil-stop lines and oil-absorbing cotton ropes were deployed to contain and prevent oil pollution. As of Thursday, 233 of the Angel's 1,349 empty containers have been hauled ashore, while 977 sank with the ship, according to TIPC.\n\nKuan says that in the event of a ship accident, Taiwanese law stipulates that shipowners must immediately take measures to prevent, eliminate, or reduce any marine pollution. She says the captain of the Angel did not take preventative actions, and that the burden of the cleanup was borne by the Taiwanese government. Kuan says that the costs of cleanup as well as losses to fishermen caused by the pollution are to be borne by the polluter. She adds that the shipowner should come forward and deal with the situation as soon as possible.",

        "body": "The latest Sims 4 expansion, Horse Ranch, has debuted with more of a sluggish trot than a hefty gallop. It's fair to say most of us Simmers have fatigue when it comes to DLC for the game, but with this one it feels more pronounced than ever. Why should we fork out another hefty fee for more content for a game that's nearly 10 years old? We're so tired, EA. Tired and skint. Of course, Sims 4 Horse Ranch is no masterpiece - here's everything the pack should have done better.\n\nEvery time horses have been in Sims games previously, players can also make their horse a unicorn. In The Sims 4 Horse Ranch pack, EA have let players just put a unicorn hat on their horses. Brilliant.\n\nOne of the big gameplay elements of Sims 4 Horse Ranch expansion pack is that the main competitions you can do with your horses is just a rabbit hole experience. Players don't get to do anything gameplay wise, it's completely shallow. The best thing you can do is watch your Sim trot about on their horse. This is an EXPANSION PACK, not a game pack. I want my game to feel enriched, not have a little sheen over it. It feels money making.\n\nShock. SHOCK. This is meant to be a family ranch gameplay pack not just adults! Give us some kids and toddlers clothes I beg.\n\nCottage Living enhances Horse Ranch but like, Cottage Living gives me all the farm fun I need. I'm not a horse girly, so maybe this pack is just not for me - but I really think we're better than this and think we could have more originality. This used to come bundled in with pets, so why are we spending so much and splitting packs up?\n\nSo annoying... Just go in your stable, babe. They're on their own agenda and it's frustrating.\n\n* Every expansion pack for The Sims 4 ranked, including the brand new Growing Together\n\n* Everything wrong with Growing Together, The Sims 4's new expansion pack",

        "title": "England hopes to be sharper in its next Women's World Cup match after underwhelming opener | TSN",
        "body": "AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Katie Robinson knows England left many unimpressed with its underwhelming 1-0 victory against overmatched Haiti in its opening match at the Women's World Cup.\n\nEngland is still tied with Denmark atop the Group D standings, regardless of how they played against Haiti, and that's all that really counts to Robinson.\n\n\"Every game at a World Cup is going to be difficult,\" Robinson said. \"Most importantly, we got the three points, and that's all that matters right now.\"\n\nWell, what actually matters next is Friday's match against Denmark in Sydney, where the top spot in the group is up for grabs as both teams try to advance to the knockout round. It is the first meeting between the two teams at the Women's World Cup, although they faced off three previous times at the European Championship.\n\nEngland defeated Denmark twice in 1984, but the Danes were the winner in 2005, the last time the two nations faced in international play. They met in a friendly in 2019, won by England 2-0.\n\nDenmark is back at the World Cup for the first time since 2007 and beat China 1-0 in its opening game.\n\nEngland understands it must pick up its play against Denmark, which is ranked 13th in the world and a far tougher opponent than Haiti.\n\n\"We're all working really hard in training to make sure we're a bit more clinical, creating more chances and obviously getting our goal percentage higher. We know it's something that we need to improve on,\" England forward Lauren Hemp said. \"We are working really hard as a team to make sure that we're ready for the game against Denmark and ready to score some goals.\"\n\nEngland is ranked fourth in the world and the reigning European champions. The Lionesses won all six of their games to win the tournament they hosted last year.\n\nBut England has not scored a goal in open play since the 23rd minute of the Women's Finalissima against Brazil on April 6 -- a span of 367 minutes.\n\n\"Heading into the World Cup, we've shown that we're dominant against a lot of teams, so we just need to be a bit more clinical and have those percentages rise in the next game,\" Hemp said.\n\nDenmark pulled out the win over China when substitute Amalie Vangsgaard scored in the 90th minute to give the Danes their sixth win in their last seven international matches. Denmark had a clean sheet in five of those games.\n\nThe Danes did not advance out of the group stage in their last two tournament appearances, but a win over England would make them the likely Group D winners. Denmark has never won two matches at a single Women's World Cup before.\n\nARGENTINA-SOUTH AFRICA\n\nHildah Magaia will play for South Africa, which believes it has a chance to win its first Women's World Cup game when it plays Argentina.\n\nMagaia scored for South Africa in its tournament opener, but was injured on the play and couldn't finish the game. Sweden went on to win 2-1, but the performance gave the South Africans confidence they can get a victory.\n\nArgentina dropped a 1-0 opener to Italy.\n\n\"Knowing that we went toe-to-toe with the No. 3 country in the world and it took a superhuman effort from them to get the result, we're very positive for the next two matches,\" South Africa coach Desiree Ellis said after the Sweden loss. \"We're not underestimating the teams, but we know our capabilities.\"\n\nMagaia and her coach both said she would \"definitely\" be able to play against Argentina.\n\nCHINA-HAITI\n\nChina and Haiti were both disappointed by opening-game losses and next face off to stay alive in Group D in a match scheduled for Adelaide, Australia.\n\nChina probably thought it would open the tournament with a win over Denmark and instead lost 1-0.\n\nChina has been to the knockout round in all six of its previous tournament appearances and probably counted Denmark as an early win. China shouldn't overlook Haiti, which surprised by hanging with European champion England in a 1-0 loss to the Lionesses.\n\nPlaying so well against England was a huge feat for Haiti, which maybe now believes it has a shot at beating China.\n\nHaiti needs to shore up its defense and has been scored on in all eight of its previous international games. But Haiti suffered a blow against England when defender Jennyfer Limage tore her ACL.\n\nChina has never lost consecutive group games in the history of the tournament.\n\n___\n\nAP Women's World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/fifa-womens-world-cup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

He said, \"Today, a bag of urea, which is sold in India at Rs 266, is being sold at Rs 800 in Pakistan, Rs 720 in Bangladesh, Rs 2,100 in China and Rs 3,000 in the US\".

However, the governing body dropped the news that she and Luik had been scratched on Wednesday just as media arrived to view the start of the team's final training session before the match.\n\nWithout both Kerr and Fowler, and with Kyah Simon still recovering from the ACL injury she sustained in October, the Matildas have only Foord as a recognised and available striker.\n\nGustavsson's options now include starting Foord up front with Emily van Egmond or Tameka Yallop, who has recovered from a corked thigh suffered in the Matildas' final friendly against France, or even Alex Chidiac.\n\nGood evening football fans!\n\nWelcome to our live blog for Australia v Nigeria in Brisbane tonight - a must-win game for the Matildas.\n\nIt's been a bumpy week for the Tillies, with Mary Fowler and Aivi Luik both ruled out with concussion (more on that later), but Australians are battlers, and although it's slim pickings for coach Tony Gustavsson when it comes to forwards, I feel confident the team will rise to the occasion.\n\nKick-off is at 8pm AEST on Channel 7, so get your green and gold shirts on and tune in to cheer on the Tillies.",

Amid the backdrop of these cases, the state of human rights and democracy in Pakistan were discussed at the event.\n\nSeveral leaders from the US House of Reps spoke during the event, raising concerns over ongoing human rights violations and the shrinking space for free expression in Pakistan.\n\nTo clarify, Pakistani-American PTI activist Khadija Shah had been arrested for alleged involvement in the arson of Lahore Corp Commander House (Jinnah House) during the May 9 violent protests. On the other hand, Imran Riaz Khan was apprehended by the Police at Sialkot International Airport on May 11 but his current location has been untraceable ever since.\n\nPakistan's recent political chaos following the arrest of PTI Chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan and the subsequent government action sparked international concern.\n\nMembers of the US Congress have been very vocal in their condemnation of the human rights violations in Pakistan. In fact, 66 members of the US Congress also wrote to Secretary of State Blinken, asking him to exert pressure on the Pakistani government in order to address the continually worsening human rights violations in the country.",

Saranno le sonorit\u00e0 siciliane di Roy Paci (21 agosto - Jazz Festival), la Notte Bianca e la Sagra della Spiga gli appuntamenti clou dell'estate gangitana. Eventi tra arte, cultura e spettacolo che testimoniano la bont\u00e0 di un cartellone vario con oltre 40 momenti diversi che si concluderanno ad ottobre. Sintesi perfetta di tanti modi di proporre e trascorrere non solo l'estate.\n\nSi inizia domani (28 luglio), alle ore 21,30, con il primo dei quattro appuntamenti del Jazz Festival, con l'esibizione di Umberto Porcaro \"Take me Home\" - La Notte del Blues. Si continua il 5 agosto con Skillie Charles Orchestra e ancora il 14 agosto con l'esibizione di Giacomo Tantillo-Bandistikamente.\n\nDel ricchissimo carnet di eventi spazio alla solidariet\u00e0 con la terza edizione \"Estate per tutti\". Il suono oltre le barriere, l'appuntamento del 2 agosto di \"Dimensione Uomo\" rivolto ai pi\u00f9 deboli.\n\nIl Forum Giovani, il 4 agosto, propone tutto in una notte per il divertimento dei pi\u00f9 giovani.

        "body": "A produ\u00e7\u00e3o sobre o projeto Manhattan tinha Rachel Brosnahan, David Harbour e outros nomes conhecidos no elenco\n\nA leitura de Christopher Nolan sobre J. Robert Oppenheimer para o cinema vai entrar para a hist\u00f3ria da s\u00e9tima arte. Mas esta n\u00e3o foi a \u00fanica produ\u00e7\u00e3o a explorar o projeto ambicioso do f\u00edsico. Em 2014, a s\u00e9rie \"Manhattan\" se dedicou a essa miss\u00e3o - s\u00f3 que de um jeito diferente.\n\nA s\u00e9rie foi um dos primeiros t\u00edtulos originais da pequena emissora WGN America. Al\u00e9m de abordar o projeto da constru\u00e7\u00e3o da bomba at\u00f4mica, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o mostra o dia a dia, sonhos e segredos dos moradores da cidade de Los Alamos.\n\nLeia mais:\n\nCriada por Sam Shaw (Masters of Sex), a produ\u00e7\u00e3o veio naquele per\u00edodo em que s\u00e9ries \"com cara de cinema\" come\u00e7avam a aparecer com mais frequ\u00eancia na televis\u00e3o.\n\nNa \u00e9poca, a emissora - que faliu em 2021 - buscava se firmar no mercado audiovisual. A inspira\u00e7\u00e3o era o sucesso da AMC, outro canal pequeno que se tornou um gigante gra\u00e7as \u00e0s s\u00e9ries \"Mad Men\", \"Breaking Bad\" e \"The Walking Dead\".\n\nA ideia do roteirista, que logo foi comprada pelos executivos da emissora, foi: um drama \u00edntimo e pessoal sobre os personagens, com narrativa lenta, elenco repleto de bons atores, produ\u00e7\u00e3o impec\u00e1vel e uma boa hist\u00f3ria real para se basear.\n\nA s\u00e9rie acompanha o cientista Frank Winter (John Benjamin Hickey), baseado em Seth Neddermeyer - que aparece em \"Oppenheimer\" na pele de Devon Bostick - um cientista recrutado para trabalhar num projeto secreto e jamais visto antes: o projeto Manhattan.\n\nFrank \u00e9 acompanhado de sua esposa, Liza (Olivia Williams), uma mulher cheia de mist\u00e9rios e que deixou uma importante miss\u00e3o para tr\u00e1s para ficar com o marido na nova cidade. Eles tamb\u00e9m t\u00eam uma filha, n\u00e3o muito explorada e presa ao arqu\u00e9tipo de \"rebelde sem causa\", vivida por Alexia Fast (Jack Reacher).\n\nEmbora a s\u00e9rie tenha como pano de fundo o projeto Manhattan, seu enredo \u00e9 bem mais sobre os personagens - quase todos fict\u00edcios - de Los Alamos do que sobre a constru\u00e7\u00e3o da bomba at\u00f4mica, ou da complicada vida de J. Robert Oppenheimer.\n\nInclusive, o f\u00edsico mal aparece na s\u00e9rie. Aqui, ele \u00e9 vivido por Daniel London, que \u00e9 creditado apenas em oito de 23 epis\u00f3dios.\n\nApesar dos personagens fict\u00edcios, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o aborda fatos hist\u00f3ricos para trazer mais veracidade ao texto - por exemplo, men\u00e7\u00f5es a Albert Einstein, aos planos de seguran\u00e7a do governo e a constru\u00e7\u00e3o da bomba at\u00f4mica.\n\nContudo, o que Shaw fez ao longo de duas temporadas foi utilizar o projeto como pano de fundo para criar uma esp\u00e9cie de \"novela de \u00e9poca\" embalada com aquela premissa de \"sexo, segredos, mentiras e reviravoltas\".\n\nA s\u00e9rie \"Manhattan\" traz um mosaico de personagens interessantes. Uma delas \u00e9 a jovem Abby, interpretada por Rachel Brosnahan (futura Lois Lane da DC), em um dos seus primeiros grandes pap\u00e9is.\n\nCasada com um dos cientistas do projeto, Charlie Isaacs (Ashley Zukerman), Abby, na verdade, \u00e9 secretamente l\u00e9sbica e apaixonada pela amiga, Elodie (Carole Weyers).\n\nN\u00e3o somente ela tinha uma trama pr\u00f3pria, como grande parte da hist\u00f3rias das outras esposas dos cientistas tamb\u00e9m foram contadas.\n\nOutra narrativa digna de destaque \u00e9 a de Helen Prins (Katja Herbers), uma das pouqu\u00edssimas mulheres vistas nos laborat\u00f3rios entre uma reuni\u00e3o e outra.\n\nEla tinha seus grandes segredos e tramas individuais. E funcionou como fio condutor da trama dos outros homens brancos e de jalecos atuando no projeto secreto.\n\nNos \u00faltimos anos, a s\u00e9rie estava encostada nos cat\u00e1logos dos streamings mais avulsos. Agora, ganhou uma onda extra de interesse do p\u00fablico, gra\u00e7as ao novo filme de Christopher Nolan.\n\nAl\u00e9m da s\u00e9rie trazer boas personagens, traz um elenco com nomes bem conhecidos atualmente. Entre eles, est\u00e3o:\n\nCom duas temporadas e 23 epis\u00f3dios no total, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o \u00e9 uma daquelas s\u00e9ries \"obrigat\u00f3rias\". Mas \u00e9 uma boa pedida para quem saiu de \"Oppenheimer\" querendo passar mais tempo neste contexto.",

        "title": "Google Unveils Multimodal Generative AI Model Med-PaLM M for Healthcare",
        "body": "Clinicians express preference for Med-PaLM M reports on chest X-rays over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of cases\n\nGoogle Health, Google Deepmind and Google AI have unveiled Med-PaLM M, a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodes and interprets biomedical data. It can handle various types of medical data, including clinical language, medical images, and genomics, and performs well on a wide range of tasks, all using the same set of model weights.\n\nIt was built by fine tuning and aligning PaLM-E, a language model from Google AI, to the medical field using a specially curated open-source benchmark called MultiMedBench. MultiMedBench consists of 7 biomedical data types and 14 diverse tasks, such as medical question-answering, generating radiology reports, and identifying genomic variations. With over 1 million samples, this benchmark encourages the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.\n\nMed-PaLM M excels in all tasks on MultiMedBench, often outperforming specialist models by a significant margin and even surpassing PaLM-E, proving the importance of adapting the model to biomedical data.\n\nThe key idea behind building a large-scale biomedical AI is to use language as a common framework for different tasks. This allows the AI to combine knowledge from various sources and transfer skills across tasks more effectively.\n\nExcitingly, preliminary evidence suggests that Med-PaLM M can generalise to new medical tasks and concepts and perform multimodal reasoning without specific training. It can accurately identify and describe medical conditions in images using only language-based instructions and prompts, even if it has never seen such cases before.\n\nTo assess the practical use of Med-PaLM M in clinical settings, radiologists evaluated AI-generated reports at different scales. The AI's error rate was found to be comparable to that of radiologists from previous studies, indicating its potential clinical usefulness. The big tech launched the first version of MedPaLM in December, 2022.\n\nRead more: Responsible AI Takes Center Stage at Google I/O Connect\n\nGoogle's Unwavering Commitment to AI in Healthcare\n\nGoogle's Med-PaLM 2, a medical chatbot that answers medical questions, has been a fan favourite since its launch.\n\nMed-PaLM 2 is built upon Google's language model, PaLM 2, and uses LLMs tailored to the medical domain. The AI has demonstrated impressive performance on medical question-answering datasets, achieving high accuracy on the US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)-style questions and the Indian AIIMS and NEET medical examination questions.\n\nGoogle acknowledges the complexity of personalised medical care and recognises that Med-PaLM 2's results may not be generalisable to every medical question-answering setting and audience. The AI is trained on medical Q/A datasets but excludes patients' personal data to adhere to ethical norms.\n\nWhile having access to patients' personal data could enhance Med-PaLM 2's efficiency, privacy concerns are likely to prevent many patients from sharing such information. Google ensures that customers testing Med-PaLM 2 will retain control of their data in encrypted settings, inaccessible to the tech company, and the AI program will not ingest any of that data.",

Patrick Cramer, pr\u00e9sident de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Max Planck, les discussions sur la publication d'une d\u00e9claration \u00e9taient en cours depuis plusieurs mois, et sa publication quelques jours avant le vote de la Knesset est arriv\u00e9e \" juste \u00e0 temps \".\n\n\" Nous voulions montrer notre solidarit\u00e9 avec nos coll\u00e8gues isra\u00e9liens, avec les amis que nous avons en Isra\u00ebl, et des scientifiques de premier plan nous demandaient de les soutenir ou de faire conna\u00eetre notre opinion \", a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 Cramer.\n\nLe \" caract\u00e8re raisonnable \" d\u00e9j\u00e0 mis \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve\n\nLe crit\u00e8re juridique de \" raisonnabilit\u00e9 \" n'est pas seulement th\u00e9orique lorsqu'il s'agit des relations scientifiques germano-isra\u00e9liennes. En 2018, le ministre des Sciences, des Technologies et de l'espace de l'\u00e9poque, Ofer Akunis, avait bloqu\u00e9 la nomination de la professeure Ya\u00ebl Amita\u00ef, chercheuse sur le cerveau \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 Ben Gurion, au conseil consultatif scientifique de la Fondation allemande pour l'Isra\u00ebl parce qu'elle avait sign\u00e9 une p\u00e9tition en 2005 appelant les soldats \u00e0 refuser de servir en Cisjordanie.\n\nAkunis a refus\u00e9 de suivre les conseils du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'\u00e9poque, Avicha\u00ef Mandelblit, et la Cour supr\u00eame a finalement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Akunis de reconsid\u00e9rer sa d\u00e9cision, d\u00e9clarant que son refus de nommer Amita\u00ef sur la base de sa signature de la p\u00e9tition \u00e9tait \" d\u00e9raisonnable \". Finalement, Amita\u00ef a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9e par le successeur d'Akunis, Izhar Shay.\n\nLors d'un entretien avec le Times of Israel depuis son bureau de Munich, Cramer a soulign\u00e9 l'importance de la science libre pour l'avenir. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'Isra\u00ebl, une petite puissance mondiale en mati\u00e8re de recherche et d'innovation, \u00e9tait un partenaire essentiel, et ce, depuis que la premi\u00e8re d\u00e9l\u00e9gation scientifique allemande en Isra\u00ebl, conduite par Otto Hahn, pr\u00e9sident de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Max Planck, a visit\u00e9 l'Institut Weizmann en 1959.\n\n\" Les Isra\u00e9liens sont ceux avec qui il faut travailler parce qu'ils collaborent et \u00e9changent des id\u00e9es. Ils \u00e9changent \u00e9galement des postdocs et des doctorants. Cet \u00e9change doit se poursuivre. Nous ne voulons pas assister \u00e0 une fuite des cerveaux isra\u00e9liens (...) mais les scientifiques ont besoin du meilleur environnement pour leur travail et d'une libert\u00e9 totale \", a-t-il d\u00e9clar\u00e9.\n\nCramer a exprim\u00e9 l'espoir que la coalition et l'opposition isra\u00e9liennes parviennent \u00e0 un compromis sur la r\u00e9forme du syst\u00e8me judiciaire et ne s'est pas aventur\u00e9 \u00e0 dire ce qu'il pourrait advenir des liens scientifiques germano-isra\u00e9liens si le gouvernement poursuivait ses projets de refonte.\n\nEn attendant, les doctorants et les post-doctorants continueront \u00e0 participer \u00e0 des programmes d'\u00e9change, tout le monde attendant avec impatience de voir comment les choses \u00e9volueront.\n\n\" Les deux parties souhaitent vivement que nous puissions continuer \u00e0 collaborer au plus haut niveau, comme nous l'avons fait par le pass\u00e9 \", a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 Cramer.",

        "title": "TRAI releases Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Repealing Regulations, 2023",
        "body": "Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) issued Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Repealing Regulations, 2023 (02 of 2023) dated July 25, 2023 to repeal the Regulation on quality of service of dial-up and leased line internet access service, 2001 (4 of 2001) with effect from date of its notification in Official Gazette.\n\nThe TRAI notified the Regulation on quality of service of dial-up and leased line internet access service, 2001 (4 of 2001) on December 10, 2001. This regulation was applicable to all the Basic Service Operators and Internet Service Providers, including the incumbent operators viz. BSNL, MTNL and VSNL. The purpose of laying down Quality of Service Parameters was to ensure customer satisfaction by laying down norms of network performance, which the service provider is required to achieve by proper dimensioning of his network; measure the Quality of Service from time to time and to compare that with the specified norms so as to monitor the level of performance, provided by various service providers and to protect the interests of subscribers of the Internet services.\n\nThese regulations were issued when the dial up service was the only service available for accessing low speed internet. With the passage of time, the telecommunication networks, both wireline as well as wireless, have evolved to offer high speed broadband service on xDSL, FTTH, LTE and 5G etc, technologies. Whereas the leased line access services are generally offered by Internet Gateway Service Providers (IGSPs) holding an ISP licence to enterprises, is a Service Level Agreement (SLA) based service. Being SLA based service, the agreement among the contracting parties has sufficient provisions to safeguard concerns regarding service quality. Hence, the regulation on quality of service of dial-up and leased line internet access service, 2001, appears to be no more relevant in the present context.\n\nIn view of the above, earlier the Authority issued draft Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Repealing Regulations, 2023 on April 03, 2023 inviting comments of the stakeholders up to April 17, 2023. Based on the comments of the stakeholders and considering the aspect of Ease of Doing Business (EoDB), the Authority has decided to repeal the Regulation on quality of service of dial-up and leased line internet access service, 2001 (4 of 2001) with effect from date of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Repealing Regulations, 2023 (02 of 2023) in Official Gazette.",

        "body": "\"Stiamo lavorando sugli obblighi deontologici del web perch\u00e9 se il nostro dipartimento sostiene l'informazione lo fa in un'ottica di responsabilit\u00e0 reciproca: il finanziamento pubblico deve servire nel mondo digitale per migliorare le norme e i comportamenti virtuosi affinch\u00e9 possano aumentare la reputazione dell'informazione e non farla decrescere\". Lo ha annunciato il sottosegretario alla Presidenza del Consiglio con delega all'Informazione e all'Editoria, Alberto Barachini, in occasione della presentazione al Senato del terzo rapporto Ital Communications-Censis dal titolo \"Disinformazione e fake news in Italia. Il sistema dell'informazione alla prova dell'Intelligenza Artificiale\". Rapporto che disegna un panorama sempre pi\u00f9 conflittuale nel mondo dell'informazione italiana. Stando al rapporto il 76,5% degli italiani ritiene che le fake news siano sempre pi\u00f9 sofisticate e difficili da scoprire, il 20,2% crede di non avere le competenze per riconoscerle e il 61,1% di averle solo in parte.\n\nStando al rapporto cresce la consapevolezza degli effetti devastanti della disinformazione, che pu\u00f2 essere arginata da professionisti della comunicazione - si legge nel documento - accreditati come fonti autorevoli e garanti dell'affidabilit\u00e0 e della qualit\u00e0 delle notizie. Di fronte alle insidie che possono venire dal web e dall'utilizzo dell'Intelligenza artificiale, per distinguere la buona dalla cattiva informazione servono competenze solide sulle nuove tecnologie e regolazioni pi\u00f9 stringenti.\n\nSecondo il rapporto cresce il bisogno di informazione, soprattutto online. Oggi circa 47 milioni di italiani, il 93,3% del totale, si informa abitualmente su almeno una delle fonti disponibili, l'83,5% sul web e il 74,1% sui media tradizionali. Sul versante opposto, sono circa 3 milioni e 300mila (il 6,7% del totale) gli individui che hanno rinunciato ad avere un'informazione puntuale su ci\u00f2 che accade, mentre 700.000 italiani non si informano affatto.\n\nIl 64,3% degli italiani utilizza un mix di fonti informative, tradizionali e online, il 9,9% si affida solo ai media tradizionali e il 19,2% (circa 10 milioni di italiani in valore assoluto) alle fonti online. Social media, blog, forum, messaggistica istantanea sono espansioni del nostro io e del modo di vedere il mondo: \u00e8 il fenomeno delle echo chambers, cui sono esposti tutti quelli che frequentano il web e soprattutto i pi\u00f9 giovani, tra i quali il 69,1% utilizza la messaggistica istantanea e il 76,6% i social media per informarsi. Il 56,7% degli italiani \u00e8 convinto che, di fronte al disordine informativo che caratterizza il panorama attuale dell'informazione, sia legittimo rivolgersi alle fonti informali di cui ci si fida di pi\u00f9.\n\nAumentano paure e timori di non essere in grado di riconoscere disinformazione e fake news. Il 76,5% degli italiani ritiene che le fake news siano sempre pi\u00f9 sofisticate e difficili da scoprire, il 20,2% crede di non avere le competenze per riconoscerle e il 61,1% di averle solo in parte. Ma ci sono anche i negazionisti: il 29,7% della popolazione nega l'esistenza delle bufale e pensa che non si debba parlare di fake news, ma di notizie vere che vengono deliberatamente censurate dai palinsesti ufficiali che poi le fanno passare come false. Il riscaldamento globale \u00e8 un argomento di cui si parla tanto e in modo confuso, alimentando cattiva informazione, catastrofismo e persino negazionismo.\n\nIl 34,7% degli italiani \u00e8 convinto che ci sia un allarmismo eccessivo sul cambiamento climatico e il 25,5% ritiene che l'alluvione di quest'anno sia la risposta pi\u00f9 efficace a chi sostiene che si sta progressivamente andando verso la desertificazione. I negazionisti, che sono convinti che il cambiamento climatico non esista, sono il 16,2% della popolazione. Gli individui pi\u00f9 fragili, vale a dire i pi\u00f9 anziani e i meno scolarizzati, sono quelli che appaiono pi\u00f9 confusi e meno in grado di comprendere il problema nella sua complessit\u00e0.",

They then tried jamming the system by making more than ordinary requests to the system. However, no data has been accessed or lost,\" said Owalo.\n\nHe also added that the government was prepared for such an attack and therefore it had put in place measures to address it and continue to improve its cyber security.\n\n\"We cannot stop digitizing our services because of hackers. What we did because we had foreseen this, is to establish and operationalize the office of the data commissioner and anchored it on law to ensure they execute the mandate of data privacy on one hand and data security on the other,\" he said.\n\n\"We are not just coming up with instant remedial solutions to address the current attack but we are ensuring that around this digitalization space, we will build an elaborate risk mitigation framework for purposes of sustainable digitalization,\" he added.\n\nThe issue with the system started a few days ago when Kenyans tried to access services in the platform but were unable to due to.\n\nSome are still experiencing a challenge in logging into the system while others have the issue settled on their end.",

        "title": "How to bridge data silos and enable cloud-like efficiency",
        "body": "Sponsored Feature Modern business decisions rely on intelligent data rather than assumptions. To make informed operational and business choices, organizations amass and store vast amounts of data.\n\nData-driven insights can significantly benefit supply chain management, resource allocation, process optimization, and understanding customer preferences. Personalized business experiences are now expected by 71 percent of consumers, and leveraging valuable data insights can meet this demand. Studies indicate that enhancing the customer experience can boost sales revenues by 2-7 percent and profitability by 1-2 percent.\n\nHowever, businesses struggle to unify data into a single source of truth. Many organizations face challenges in establishing innovative, data-driven processes.\n\nA recent Statista survey of 116 businesses worldwide reveals that many firms still struggle to establish innovative, data-driven organizations. This becomes problematic as digital transformations proceed without sufficient data intelligence. Data silos, inadequate infrastructure to handle growing data volumes, and unstructured data impede the unlocking of data's full potential.\n\nThe exponential growth of data, estimated to be twice as large by 2025, further compounds the issue. Merely collecting and storing data is insufficient; the real challenge lies in extracting meaningful insights for strategic decision-making.\n\nCommon hurdles in unlocking data value and intelligence include:\n\n- Multiple data silos: Silos obstruct data availability and value, necessitating their dismantling to facilitate data access, security, sharing, and collaboration.\n\n- Inadequate infrastructure for high data volumes: Existing on-premises infrastructure may lack the processing power and storage capacity required. Moving resources to the cloud is an option, but it can be costly and complex. Hybrid solutions have gained popularity.\n\n- Unstructured data: Scattered across various locations and formats, unstructured data is difficult to integrate, organize, analyze, and gain insights from.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a robust data management solution that aggregates data from silos, offers valuable insights regardless of storage location, and automates processes using AI. Let's explore how Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) GreenLake provides such a solution.\n\nWave goodbye to data silos\n\nHPE GreenLake, an edge-to-cloud platform, enables data-first modernization through various services. By integrating existing infrastructures with cloud resources, organizations can adopt a cloud-like experience without full migration. The platform allows businesses to maximize their edge investments while capitalizing on cloud scalability, agility, and innovation.\n\nThe platform also analyzes data wherever it resides, to address cost and complexity concerns associated with sending, storing, and analyzing data in the cloud. It eliminates data silos and empowers organizations to extract real-time insights from their operations, delivering a holistic view of their data-driven insights.\n\nWith this approach, companies can also apply the same data management policies, rules and deployments across their on-premise and cloud environments with minimal overhead.\n\nOffered on a self-service, pay-as-you-go model, HPE GreenLake provides businesses with control over accessing and consuming services. The automated self-service functionality enables provisioning, configuration, and management of IT resources according to specific requirements.\n\nThe pay-as-you-go model eliminates upfront capital expenditures, allowing businesses to scale resources based on demand and align IT spending with operational needs.\n\nHPE GreenLake gives customers the opportunity to get a true picture of activities across their hybrid estate by offering an analytics dashboard that can display key features, such as consumption analytics, continuous regulatory compliance monitoring, and fast provisioning.\n\n\"Businesses now have the opportunity to use the HPE GreenLake Cloud Portal (GLCP), which is designed to harmonize all the assets owned by a company into a single pane, which can be fed over time into an analytics backend, allowing businesses to have an overview of how their data is performing,\" says Williams.\n\nSeveral case studies highlight how HPE GreenLake adoption has helped companies sustain business growth through data intelligence.\n\nIn summary, data is a valuable resource, but its true worth lies in the insights it provides. HPE GreenLake aims to bridge data silos and enable cloud-like efficiency within on-premises infrastructure. By maintaining control, governance, security, and familiarity, organizations can achieve data-first business transformation.",

The new security-oriented feature simply surfaces existing tools on WhatsApp to make it easier for users to deal with unwanted contact on the Meta-owned messaging service. These features have been rolled out to some users who have signed up to receive beta versions of WhatsApp for Android and are likely to roll out to all users at a later date.\n\nAs part of the latest WhatsApp beta for Android 2.23.16.6 update, the messaging platform has rolled out support for a new Safety tools section that shows up when an unknown person -- or business account -- messages you for the first time. The new card, spotted on the beta release by WhatsApp feature tracker WABetaInfo, also informs you about how profile photos work on the service and how to check the phone number of the sender.\n\nScreenshots of both features shared by the feature tracker\n\nPhoto Credit: WABetaInfo\n\nAccording to a screenshot shared by WABetaInfo, the messaging app will display a card with two options that allow you to block or report an unknown sender when they message you for the first time. These are options that already exist on the platform -- WhatsApp has offered blocking and reporting for years. However, making them more easily accessible could help users deal with unwanted spam with a couple of taps.\n\nThe new safety tools tab will also inform you that profile photos and users are set by users on WhatsApp and not verified by the platform. This is presumably to warn users to be careful when texting unknown users and to protect themselves from scams that are popular on messaging apps. WhatsApp also asks users to check the country code while responding to messages from known senders.\n\nMeanwhile, WABetaInfo reports that the recently released WhatsApp beta for Android 2.23.16.3 update adds a feature that could make it easy for you to share details with a group of contacts on the platform. After updating to the beta version, you should see an option to create a new group at the top right corner of the screen, when you are forwarding a message on WhatsApp.\n\nThe shortcut to create a group while forwarding a message is likely to make it easier to share content on WhatsApp. On the stable version of WhatsApp, you'll need to create a group first, then go to to the message you want to forward and select the newly created group.\n\nIt is worth noting that both these new features are currently in beta testing and there is no word on when they will be released to all users on the stable channel. WhatsApp is yet to roll out these features to testers on iOS -- which suggests that it could be a few weeks before they are available for all users on iOS and Android.",

        "title": "Google Unveils Multimodal Generative AI Model Med-PaLM M for Healthcare",
        "body": "Clinicians express preference for Med-PaLM M reports on chest X-rays over those produced by radiologists in up to 40.50% of cases\n\nGoogle Health, Google Deepmind and Google AI have unveiled Med-PaLM M, a large multimodal generative model that flexibly encodes and interprets biomedical data. It can handle various types of medical data, including clinical language, medical images, and genomics, and performs well on a wide range of tasks, all using the same set of model weights.\n\nIt was built by fine tuning and aligning PaLM-E, a language model from Google AI, to the medical field using a specially curated open-source benchmark called MultiMedBench. MultiMedBench consists of 7 biomedical data types and 14 diverse tasks, such as medical question-answering, generating radiology reports, and identifying genomic variations. With over 1 million samples, this benchmark encourages the development of generalist biomedical AI systems.\n\nMed-PaLM M excels in all tasks on MultiMedBench, often outperforming specialist models by a significant margin and even surpassing PaLM-E, proving the importance of adapting the model to biomedical data.\n\nThe key idea behind building a large-scale biomedical AI is to use language as a common framework for different tasks. This allows the AI to combine knowledge from various sources and transfer skills across tasks more effectively.\n\nExcitingly, preliminary evidence suggests that Med-PaLM M can generalise to new medical tasks and concepts and perform multimodal reasoning without specific training. It can accurately identify and describe medical conditions in images using only language-based instructions and prompts, even if it has never seen such cases before.\n\nTo assess the practical use of Med-PaLM M in clinical settings, radiologists evaluated AI-generated reports at different scales. The AI's error rate was found to be comparable to that of radiologists from previous studies, indicating its potential clinical usefulness. The big tech launched the first version of MedPaLM in December, 2022.\n\nRead more: Responsible AI Takes Center Stage at Google I/O Connect\n\nGoogle's Unwavering Commitment to AI in Healthcare\n\nGoogle's Med-PaLM 2, a medical chatbot that answers medical questions, has been a fan favourite since its launch.\n\nMed-PaLM 2 is built upon Google's language model, PaLM 2, and uses LLMs tailored to the medical domain. The AI has demonstrated impressive performance on medical question-answering datasets, achieving high accuracy on the US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE)-style questions and the Indian AIIMS and NEET medical examination questions.\n\nGoogle acknowledges the complexity of personalised medical care and recognises that Med-PaLM 2's results may not be generalisable to every medical question-answering setting and audience. The AI is trained on medical Q/A datasets but excludes patients' personal data to adhere to ethical norms.\n\nWhile having access to patients' personal data could enhance Med-PaLM 2's efficiency, privacy concerns are likely to prevent many patients from sharing such information. Google ensures that customers testing Med-PaLM 2 will retain control of their data in encrypted settings, inaccessible to the tech company, and the AI program will not ingest any of that data.",

        "body": "In a short video, a doctor narrates the story of a woman who lost her eye. He emphasised the reasons why one should never use contact lenses.\n\nDo you choose contact lenses over glasses? Then this TikTok doctor's revelation might make you question your decision. In his short video online segment titled 'New Fear Unlocked', the man named GP Samuel detailed why you must never rely on contact lenses. According to LadBible, in the TikTok clip, he shared the story of the woman who had to get her eye removed owing to a severe infection. Hailing from Leicestershire, Marie Mason quickly developed a strange problem after wearing contact lenses. The doctor claimed she would often shower keeping her lenses on which became the root cause of the infection.\n\nUpon inspection by an eye specialist, the woman was diagnosed with a severe contact lens-related infection. \"They found that this was caused by a parasite that can be found in tap water that can go underneath your contact lens when you shower. That parasite is called acanthamoeba,\" he reportedly said. GP Samuel emphasized the problem wasn't caused by a virus or bacteria, which meant that a typical antibiotic drop did not work effectively against it. Notably, the woman suffered for five years during which she underwent three corneal transplants but nothing came to fruition.\n\nEventually, she had to opt for a complete eye removal to get rid of the infection. The TikTok doctor suggested the chances of contracting acanthamoeba are extremely rare. The possibility is said to be one in 5000 people but he warned when the infection becomes severe it can lead to vision loss. In the segment, the doctor also ended up highlighting prevention techniques to minimize the risk of infection while wearing lenses. He strictly cautioned against sleeping, swimming, or showing up without removing them. \"Always wash your hands before handling contact lenses, only use approved solutions, and change your lens case regularly,\" he continued.\n\nIn another segment titled '10 things I will never do ever since I became a doctor', GP Samuel said he will never choose to wear contact lenses. He believes most people do not know the severity of contact lens- an infection that can deprive an individual of maintaining normal vision.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Marie Mason first began experiencing discomfort in her eye in 2015. She underwent three corneal procedures to treat the damage leading up to her eye removal in March 2020. She reportedly wears a false replacement ever since the surgery.",

We are also trying to preserve their mental and physical health.\n\n\"It is quite important that the career is also being cared for because most times we look at health workers as just people who care for other people, but we have come to realize that doctors, nurses and other health workers are just as vulnerable as other members of the society\". He said.\n\nWhile officially launching the Y2023 State Continuing Medical Education programme, Ogboye stated that the State Government remains committed and determined to ensuring best practises in health care delivery and will continue to insist that the environment in which medical care is provided should be conducive to the promotion and maintenance of good health.\n\nProfessor Akin Osibogun, who delivered a lecture titled \"Leading and Influencing Positive Changes in the Health Sector,\" explained that good leadership in the health sector must be in tune with technological skills, high-quality managerial skills, and social skills in order to communicate and interact with stakeholders at all levels.\n\nHe stated that health-care leaders must always consider the next generation of leaders and must ensure that they train and develop the potential of their younger colleagues for critical leadership roles in order to have a good succession plan in health-care service delivery.\n\n\"A good leader in the health sector must be equipped with technological skills in the field, managerial skills that will enable him to plan, implement and evaluate programmes by following management processes and social skills to be able to communicate and interact with stakeholders at all levels\". He said.\n\nProfessor Osibogun encouraged all health care workers to move towards achieving a positive changes in health care service delivery as a positive change in health care delivery will enhance a sustainable health care delivery that will be of a great benefit to the citizenry\n\nEarlier, the Director, Medical Administration, Training and Programs, Dr. Olufunmilayo Shokunbi explained that the CME programme is a capacity building strategy of the Government targeted at addressing the health needs of caregivers so that they can discharge their duties optimally.\n\nShe noted that the Lagos State Government recognizes the importance of having a smart workforce, and that is why the CME programme would be addressing carefully selected topics that will add value to health workers.\n\nShokunbi urged health workers in Lagos State to continue to avail themselves with necessary knowledge that will ultimately enhance their service delivery and wellbeing.\n\nOne of the participants at the programme, Dr. Tolu Ajomale, commended the Lagos State Government for being consistent in organizing the yearly CME programme and other strategic workshop for health worker.\n\nHe said that the training programme will avail participants the opportunity to learn, unlearn and relearn.

        "body": "To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com.\n\nOn 19 July 2023, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) published a draft Reflection paper on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the lifecycle of medicines (the Paper). The Paper recognises the value of this technology as part of the digital transformation within healthcare, and acknowledges its increasing use and potential to \"support the acquisition, transformation, analysis, and interpretation of data within the medicinal product lifecycle\", provided of course it is \"used correctly\".\n\nThe Paper reflects EMA's early experience with and considerations on the use of AI, and gives a sense of how EMA expects applicants and holders of marketing authorisations to use AI and machine learning (ML) tools. The EMA has made clear that the use of AI should comply with existing rules on data requirements as applicable to the particular function that the AI is undertaking. It is clear that any data generated by AI/ML will be closely scrutinised by the EMA, and a risk-based approach should be taken depending on the AI functionality and the use for which the data is generated.\n\nThe Paper is open for consultation until 31 December 2023. EMA also plans to hold a workshop on 20-21 November 2023 to further discuss the draft Paper. EMA's plan is to use the feedback from the public consultation to finalise the Paper and produce future detailed guidance. Our summary below sets out the key takeaways and the key issues that arise in the Paper.\n\nUse of AI by physicians to support clinical decisions and imaging analysis is increasingly common. EMA's Paper represents, however, a deeper dive and covers every step in the medicines' lifecycle and identifies the areas which fall within EMA's or national authorities' remit. From drug discovery to pharmacovigilance, marketing authorisation applicants and holders will need to have in place mechanisms that ensure that AI and ML are transparent, accessible, validated and monitored. EMA highlights that it is their responsibility to ensure that \"all algorithms, models, datasets, and data processing pipelines used are fit for purpose and are in line with ethical, technical, scientific, and regulatory standards as described in GxP standards and current EMA scientific guidelines\".\n\nThe Paper covers the following stages in the medicines lifecycle:\n\nWhere AI/ML use is expected to impact the benefit-risk, even potentially, of the medicinal product, developers are advised to interact with the regulators as early as possible (i.e., through scientific advice or qualification of innovative development methods). The greater the potential regulatory impact or risk, the greater the scrutiny by the relevant competent authorities. This means that marketing authorisation applicants/holders will have to consider all the stages where AI/ML systems have been used and assess what is the effect on the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product.\n\nTaking as an example the use of AI/ML tools to select participants to clinical trials or analyse the data obtained during the trials: while it is the responsibility of the sponsor of the clinical trial to ensure, for example, that the use of AI/ML systems comply with statistical principles for clinical trials, ethical rules, or technical aspects, it is for the marketing authorisation applicant to \"convince\" EMA or the national authorities that data obtained through the use of AI/ML is trustworthy, reliable and robust. If the applicant does not have a good understanding of the related processes or functioning of the AI/ML model, there is a risk that the applicant will not be able to appropriately support its application for a marketing authorisation.\n\nThe Paper covers the technical parameters that need to be taken into consideration when using AI/ML systems throughout the stages of the medicinal product lifecycle. These involve in particular:\n\nAI/ML systems may qualify as medical devices regulated under the EU Medical Devices Regulations. While the qualification and classification of such systems is defined by the medical devices legislation, EMA will assess AI/ML medical devices used in clinical trials and that generate data to support marketing authorisation applications for medicinal products. In particular, EMA will consider whether use of the AI/ML can generate robust data to support the marketing authorisation application, and the regulatory status of the AI/ML will be considered by other relevant authorities.\n\nIn parallel, it is worth highlighting that the AI/ML systems will also be subject to the EU AI Act, once adopted. See our recent advisory for a summary of the current status of the Act.\n\nMarketing authorisation applicants and holders are advised to comply with the ethical principles provided in the guidelines for trustworthy AI and presented in Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence for self-assessment (ALTAI). EMA also provides that an impact analysis should be systematically conducted at an early stage.\n\nIn addition, collection and processing of personal data must take place in accordance with the applicable legislation on data protection. The Paper recommends the use of risk assessments focused on AI.\n\nEMA highlights that many recommendations and best practices also apply to the field of AI/ML and provides a useful list of relevant guidance at the end of the Paper.",

        "body": "A quarter of smokers believe the money they could save from quitting the habit would be \"life changing\" - and a third feel guilty about the amount they spend on cigarettes. The research of 1,500 smokers revealed 32 per cent predict they'll be paying \u00a31 or more per cigarette before the end of 2024 - but 26 per cent reckon they will be forced to try and quit if the \u00a31 threshold is crossed, due to the cost.\n\nPerhaps counter-intuitively, a quarter of smokers regard the idea of a \u00a31 cigarette to be a bigger psychological trigger to push them to quit, than the idea of paying \u00a320 for a pack of 20. The findings are part of the \"IQOS No Smoke Index\", an ongoing research project designed to better understand the challenges faced by UK smokers attempting to quit cigarettes.\n\nHarry Wake, from IQOS - a tobacco heating system that, unlike cigarettes, produce no fire, ash, or smoke - said: \"The cost of cigarettes is clearly a huge factor for many smokers seeking cheaper and less harmful alternatives.\n\n\"The research shows there's definitely a psychological trigger in paying more than a pound for a single cigarette, and it looks as though rising costs will naturally push people to the limits of what they can afford to pay for a habit - it is getting to the point of not being sustainable.\"\n\nThe research also revealed 24 per cent believe price is a big factor in whether they continue to smoke, while 16 per cent admit that their family would notice the financial benefit if they stopped smoking cigarettes. Other triggers to try and quit, according to the index, conducted via OnePoll, would be if a child or grandchild asked them to - or if a partner pleaded with them to do so.\n\nMore than four in ten (41 per cent) have already attempted a switch to vaping to try and cut smoking, while 32 per cent have tried nicotine patches, and 27 per cent have turned to gums or lozenges. However, 39 per cent of smokers admitted to using no aids or methods during their last quit attempt, instead choosing to go \"cold turkey\" - but only nine per cent managed to stay off the habit for longer than a month.\n\nHarry Wake, from IQOS, added: \"While everyone knows the best choice any smoker can make is to quit tobacco and nicotine products completely, for those that don't, switching completely presents less risk to your health than continuing to smoke. \"Of course, it's easier said than done when it comes to stopping smoking, but the benefits are there for all to see - health and wealth, it's a win-win all round.\"",

        "body": "Sinead O'Connor saw herself as a protest singer, rather than a pop star and used her fame as a force for good to make the world a better place\n\nSinead O'Connor used her fame to \"break down stigmas\" after insisting she was not a pop star, but a \"protest singer\".\n\nThe star sadly died on Thursday at the age of 56, just 18 months after her 17-year-old son Shane took his own life.\n\nThroughout her career she always challenged norms, from her trademark shaved head which became her signature look, to championing causes close to her heart and often sharing controversial views.\n\nOne of her biggest punk rock moments was when she tore up a picture of Pope John Paul II on US TV show Saturday Night Live in 1992 in protest at the Catholic Church child abuse scandal.\n\nAbused herself as a child and sent to one of Ireland's notorious Magdalene Laundries when she was 14, her act of defiance got her banned from SNL for life and a backlash followed.\n\nSinead kept her hair short throughout her life to avoid abuse from men ( Image: VEVO/YouTube/Avalon)\n\nDespite never having another hit in America after her song Nothing Compares 2 U came out, Sinead refused to bite her tongue.\n\nIn her memoir, Rememberings, she says: \"The media was making me out to be crazy because I wasn't acting like a pop star is supposed to act. I feel that having a No.1 record derailed my career and my tearing up the [Pope] photo put me back on the right track.\"\n\nBy the time Sinead appeared on Saturday Night Live she had already been branded \"crazy\" for boycotting the 1991 Grammy Awards when her album I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got was named best alternative music performance.\n\nIn a letter to the academy, she said the awards \"acknowledge mostly the commercial side of art\", but that she believed an artist's purpose was to \"inspire and, in some way, guide and heal the human race, of which we are all equal members\".\n\nShe had no regrets about tearing the then Pope's photo up, saying: \"I'm not sorry I did it. It was brilliant. But it was very traumatising. It was open season on treating me like a crazy b***h.\"\n\nTearing up the Pope's photo in protest at abuse in the Catholic Church on SNL ( Image: Yvonne Hemsey/Getty Images)\n\nA group called the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations hired a steamroller to crush hundreds of her albums outside her company's headquarters, actor Joe Pesci threatened to smack her in an SNL monologue and Frank Sinatra called her \"one stupid broad\".\n\nIn another act of defiance, Sinead became ordained as a priest and announced she wanted to be known as Mother Bernadette Mary.\n\nShe went on to convert to Islam in 2018 and adopted the name Shuhada' Davitt, later Shuhada Sadaqat -- although she continued to use Sinead O'Connor professionally.\n\nBut whatever life threw at her, Sinead continued to be herself and often spoke out on abuse that was happening in her native Ireland and elsewhere, particularly to women.\n\nWomen's Aid Ireland, which works to prevent and help victims of domestic abuse, said she helped change the country for the better calling her a \"fearless voice and courageous light\".\n\nSinead was ordained a priest in 1991 and adopted the name Mother Bernadette Mary ( Image: PA)\n\n\"You truly challenged Ireland, and a world, that stifled women, children and anyone who didn't conform,\" the organisation tweeted. \"Your power, your anger, your pain and fragility gave strength to many survivors to speak out.\"\n\nSinead was also a supporter of people living with HIV and AIDS and famously wore a T-shirt supporting what was then the Dublin AIDS Alliance on The Late, Late Show in 1990.\n\nSpeaking about what a difference it made, writer and AIDS survivor Jason Reid said: \"Sinead O'Connor cared. In Ireland, Sinead publicly supported people with HIV/AIDS when many denigrated us.\n\n\"She used her fame to help break down stigma and bring about change. We were lucky to have Sinead.\"\n\nWhen it came to her hair, some might have believed her shaved head was a trademark fashion statement, but Sinead revealed the real reason she preferred the cropped style.\n\nIn an emotional interview with TV psychologist Dr Phil, she said she remained bald because she didn't want to be viewed as 'pretty'. And she feared that if she was seen in that light, that she could be subjected to danger at the hands of men.\n\nShe shared: \"It was dangerous to be pretty because I was getting raped and molested everywhere I went. That was a huge part of it.\"\n\n* If you've been the victim of sexual assault, you can access help and resources via www.rapecrisis.org.uk or calling the national telephone helpline on 0808 802 9999\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads",

        "title": "Does Fiber Help You Lose Weight? How Does It Work 2023?",
        "body": "Does Fiber Help You Lose Weight? Dietary fiber has a role in managing several diseases shown in different clinical studies. We need high-fiber foods for our metabolism, digestive system, and gut health and to prevent related chronic diseases such as obesity.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration defines dietary fiber as all carbohydrates that are neither digested nor absorbed in the small intestine. Dietary fiber effects depend on chemical characteristics such as solubility, viscosity, and fermentability which determine the fiber functions in the body.\n\nThese functions can be related to digestive functions, micronutrient availability, gut transit time, stool formation, and microbiota profile. Altogether, these effects benefit different chronic diseases.\n\nSo how much fiber do you need? Researchers and specialists recommended a daily intake for adults of 25-35 grams of fiber per day. However, the average daily dietary fiber intake remains lower than 20 grams per day in adults worldwide.\n\nHigh fiber intake in the dietis important for both weight loss and overall health benefits, and you can get fiber only from plant-based foods. Here is a high-fiber foods list with their fiber amounts per portion.\n\nThe fiber characteristics affect sugar and fat absorption, stool structure, and frequency. These functions help regulate the digestive system.\n\nSolubility is the ability of dietary fibers to dissolve in water. Insoluble fibers remain as discrete particles in water. Soluble dietary fibers thicken when they cross with water and have a role in the digestive tract concentration-dependent manner.\n\nDietary fiber intake also changes microbiota composition, stimulating the production of secondary metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids that are an important nutrient for beneficial bacteria in the intestine.\n\nIt is easier to access and metabolize soluble dietary fiber for fiber-degrading microorganisms in the intestine than with insoluble dietary fiber. Soluble fibers help to produce beneficial and functional metabolites.\n\nHere are the soluble and insoluble dietary fiber sources:\n\nSome fermentable fibers function as prebiotics. Prebiotic is a term for \"a substrate that is selectively utilized by host microorganisms conferring a health benefit\". Inulin-type fibers and galactooligosaccharides are prebiotic fibers.\n\nPrebiotic fibers have a fermentative capacity and lead to the release of short-chain fatty acids. It is a substrate for stimulating the growth of beneficial bacteria, as we mentioned above. In 2018, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 64 randomized controlled trials demonstrated that fiber, especially fructans, and galactooligosaccharides, increases the Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, beneficial bacteria species, in microbiota.\n\nAs you can see from the research results, fiber will help you lose weight, but how? What are the mechanisms that fiber provides for weight loss?\n\nThe health benefits of fibers are mostly related to the digestive system. Fiber intake can increase the amount of food intake while reducing total energy intake because the energy density of higher-fiber foods is lower than low-fiber foods. Soluble fibers can increase the time in the stomach during digestion and delay or decrease sugar and fat absorption in the intestine.\n\nThis mechanism reduces both the absorption of calories and insulin secretion from the pancreas. Therefore fiber consumption is helpful for weight loss, blood sugar, and insulin control.\n\nDigestive problems, mainly constipation, are major findings of people with high body weight. Therefore, regulating digestive problems and relaxing the bowels helps the management of body weight and increases the quality of life.\n\nFiber intake can decrease gut transit time, which means better constipation management and defecation frequency increment. Research conducted with healthy individuals showed that an increased additional nine grams of wheat bran for three days compared to a low-fiber control diet significantly lowered gut transit time, also called gastric emptying.\n\nWheat bran supplementation increased stool frequency from one per day to 1.5 cups per day. Other studies have shown that supplementation with cellulose-pectin combination, short-chain fructooligosaccharides supplements, and high-fiber breakfast cereals also increase stool frequency. According to these effects, fibers can flatten your abdominal area and help you to lose belly fat.\n\nYou burn calories while you digest food called the thermic effect of food. The meal volume (larger meal size) and the effort you give to digest are related to this calorie expenditure. Therefore, dietary carbohydrate with high fiber increases the thermic effect of foods. Thus, high-fiber, high-protein diets are perfect for increasing energy expenditure.\n\nWhen it comes to appetite control, dietary fibers are our best supporters of us. Because fiber consumption, primarily soluble fibers, helps you hold a large amount of water and increase tension in the stomach wall, which triggers signals from the digestive system to the brain called vagal signals which give feedback to the brain about fullness and satiation. Also, you produce more short-chain fatty acids in the intestine if you consume dietary fibers that can be fermented by bacteria. Short-chain fatty acids also decrease your hunger and control your appetite with the stimulation of the secretion of special peptides in the intestine to suppress appetites, such as cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide-1, peptide YY, etc. These molecules also go to the brain and say you are done with eating.\n\nPeople with high weight generally have impaired blood sugar control, increased blood fat and cholesterol levels, and constipation are common in them. Dietary fibers help you to lose weight by reducing obesity-related outcomes or improving your overall health by eliminating these health problems.\n\nA review of large prospective cohort studies indicated that consumption of more than 28 grams per day for women and 38 grams for men of insoluble cereal fibers or whole-grain products might reduce insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes risk by 20-30%.\n\nWater-soluble viscous-forming dietary fibers help to reduce total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (bad cholesterol) levels by about 5-10%. High-fiber foods, such as oats, barley, legumes, flax seeds, apples, and citrus foods, show cholesterol-lowering benefits.\n\nDietary fibers have a role in the excretion of bile and cholesterol in the stool. It is an essential mechanism for both high blood cholesterol and fatty liver disease.\n\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of seven studies concluded that fiber consumption is an effective treatment for chronic constipation in adults compared with a placebo. These studies showed that dietary fiber such as wheat bran, supplement forms such as psyllium, and prebiotics such as inulin increased stool frequency and normalized stool consistency.\n\nFiberous products contain phytates that reduce the absorption of dietary minerals such as iron, zinc, and calcium. But also, several human studies have shown that specific fibers, such as fructans and galactooligosaccharides, may increase dietary calcium absorption.\n\nIf you have inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's or ulcerative colitis, or irritable bowel syndrome, you should consult your doctor about your dietary fiber intake. Because in such cases, the gut and microbiota may not function normally and may affect how you tolerate dietary fibers. Also, some dietary approaches, such as a lectin-free diet, restrict several high-fiber foods due to other structures these foods contain.\n\nDoes Fiber Help You Lose Weight? Dietary fiber is a potent diet strategy for weight loss, as it is in many ways for health promotion. It helps you control your appetite by transmitting satiety signals from the digestive system to the brain.\n\nIt positively supports bacterial diversity in the microbiota, which is associated with many diseases. In addition, it provides blood sugar and insulin regulation by prolonging the digestion and absorption times while also binding and removing some fat and cholesterol.\n\nAll these are functional mechanisms for weight loss. However, it is beneficial to choose the fiber sources that you consume with your doctor and registered dietitian, considering your health status.",

All the core competencies, fire rescue, hazmat, EMS, rescue, leadership.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nMario Troncoso first attended TEEX Fire Training School in the early 1990s. Now, three decades later, he is back to serve as an adjunct instructor teaching fire service leadership development and strategy in tactics unique to firefighting.\n\n\"Taking all the classes and then realizing that commitment that the instructors have given to come here for free, I wanted to give back,\" said Troncoso, who serves as the fire chief at Cibolo Fire Department. \"That's why I wanted to be an adjunct instructor and come back and gain the knowledge from the other instructors here and of course spread the knowledge that I've gained to other volunteer career firefighters.\"\n\nThe training he has received from TEEX has been formative throughout his time as a firefighter and fire chief, Troncoso said.\n\n\"I can honestly say, it's been very, very tremendous to my career,\" he said. \"Gaining the basics as a firefighter, coming into my leadership development, I went through the Fire Service Chief Executive Officer Program that they have here as well. That helped me in my current position as the fire chief.\"\n\nThis year, Texas A&M Forest Services (TAMFS) provided $459,988 in grants to over 626 firefighters across 190 departments through the Rural Volunteer Fire Department Assistance Program, a cost-sharing program funded by the Texas Legislature. Through these grants, TAMFS covers tuition, food and lodging for nearly 50% of the state's county volunteer firefighters to attend TEEX's annual training. The funding also provides firefighting vehicles, equipment and clothing to volunteer fire departments.\n\nWorters said without these grants, her department wouldn't have been able to attend this year's training.\n\n\"Some of the trainings that they have are just wonderful,\" she said. Last year, I did the confined space [training], and it was the whole week, you're just amped up. The training is fantastic. It sets you up really well for any rescue scenarios. The instructors are really wonderful.\"\n\nIn an effort to conserve, all water used in training is cleaned and reused on sight. Recent studies which found evidence of PFAS in firefighting foam is not a concern for TEEX as the organization does not use fluorinated compounds in its firefighting foam, Lohmeyer said.\n\n\"We actually have a closure with the state of Texas to ensure that our systems are clean,\" he said. \"I don't want to say we're exempt from that but, we don't use fluorinated compounds.\"\n\nThe annual training included firefighting demonstrations open to the public Wednesday night at Brayton Fire Training Field. The demonstration consisted of explanations for techniques used to fight fires on several large, live-fire training props.\n\nTags Education Job Market Security And Public Safety School Systems Business Politics The Economy Social Services Welfare Business And Commercial Law Sociology Get local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

Photograph: ANI Photo\n\n\"I could not say anything after that and it was the last time I heard from him,\" Kanta Devi told PTI as she broke down into tears.\n\nSingh, a native of Jammu, was commissioned into 18 Grenadiers at the age of 18. During the Kargil war, 18 Grenadiers were tasked with recapturing the Tiger Hill with two other battalions.\n\nThe battalion launched an attack and came under intense fire from the enemy after reaching the hill top. Singh died in the gun battle and was awarded a Sena Medal posthumously.\n\nKanta Devi, who was visiting the Lamochen View Point here to attend an event to commemorate the 24th Kargil Vijay Diwas, said she has preserved her son's bullet-riddled wallet.\n\n\"It has bloodstains on it and contains some crumpled currency notes. When I die, I want it to be consigned to the flames with me. There is no bigger pain for a mother than to see her son die. He was supposed to be the one to light my funeral pyre,\" said an inconsolable Kanta Devi.\n\n\"But his words and dedication towards the nation make me proud,\" she said.\n\nDuring his year-long service, whenever Singh visited home, his family would distribute sweets in their neighbourhood.\n\n\"Somehow, I always felt that I needed to celebrate his return. A mother's heart just knows. When he went back the last time, I knew he wasn't coming back,\" Kanta Devi said.\n\nThe Indian Army had launched a fierce counterassault, Operation Vijay, to push back Pakistani forces that had stealthily occupied important heights in Ladakh in 1999.\n\nThe Kargil War saw Indian soldiers fight in the most challenging terrain under harsh weather conditions leading to the defeat of the enemy in Drass, Kargil and Batalik sectors.\n\nKargil Vijay Diwas is observed on July 26 every year to mark India's victory over Pakistan.",

        "body": "A new study by researchers who have developed a diet score that encompasses both ecological and health-related factors.\n\nEating more planet-friendly foods could help reduce the risk of death from cancer, heart disease, respiratory illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases, according to a new study by researchers who have developed a diet score that encompasses both ecological and health-related factors. Wholegrain cereals, fruit, vegetables, nuts and unsaturated oils are just some of the foods that can help reduce the carbon footprint of our diets while improving health, according to a new study. Drawing on scientific literature on the subject, the authors of this research have established a new diet score called the \"Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI)\", which is based on both planet-friendly foods and those that promote better health.\n\nThe aim is to create a simple tool, \"that policymakers and public health practitioners could use to develop strategies to improve public health and address the climate crisis,\" explains a news release for the study. \"A sustainable dietary pattern should not only be healthy but also consistent within planetary boundaries for greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental parameters,\" says researcher Linh Bui, MD, a PhD candidate in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nAlso read: Chennai Street Food Vendor Makes Colourful 'Panda Dosa' And It is Too Cute to Eat\n\nThe study was based on the EAT-Lancet reference diet, which takes into account the environmental impact of food production practices. Results obtained from over 100,000 people who participated in two large cohort studies conducted in the United States were also taken into account. According to the research led by Linh Bui, people who followed a more environmentally-friendly diet were 25% less likely to die over a follow-up period of more than 30 years, compared with those who regularly ate less environmentally-friendly foods such as eggs or red meat.\n\nIn detail, they found that higher PHDI scores were associated with a 15% lower risk of death from cancer or cardiovascular disease. The benefits were even greater for neurodegenerative and respiratory diseases, with a reduction in the risk of death estimated at 20% and 50% respectively.\n\nThe study findings were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, held from July 22 to 25 in Boston. Linh Bui points out, however, that the PHDI index does not necessarily reflect all food products and their relationships with all major diseases in all countries. \"People with specific health conditions, religious restrictions, or different food accessibility due to socioeconomic status or food availability may face challenges with adhering to a more sustainable diet pattern. Further research could help to elucidate and address such barriers,\" the study news release explains.",

        "title": "Heiz\u00f6lpreise Stadt Pforzheim aktuell: Alles zur Preisentwicklung und zum \u00d6lverbrauch in Ihrer N\u00e4he",
        "body": "Wie sich die Preise f\u00fcr Heiz\u00f6l in Ihrer N\u00e4he t\u00e4glich entwickeln, wie viel Heiz\u00f6l in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg verbraucht wird, und worauf Sie bei der Heiz\u00f6lbestellung achten m\u00fcssen, lesen Sie hier auf news.de.\n\nHeiz\u00f6lpreise, Lieferzeiten und Prognosen zur Preisentwicklung schwanken in der Bundesrepublik stetig und unterscheiden sich nicht nur tagesaktuell, sondern auch regional sehr stark. 98,97 Euro zahlen Sie aktuell, am 27.07.2023, in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg durchschnittlich f\u00fcr 100 Liter Heiz\u00f6l. Wie genau steht es in Pforzheim um den Heiz\u00f6l-Preis und welche aktuellen Lieferfristen gibt es?\n\n96,71 Euro bezahlen Sie durchschnittlich heute f\u00fcr 100 Liter in der Stadt Pforzheim. Damit liegt der Preis in Pforzheim unter dem Durchschnitt von Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Beachten Sie, dass sich dieser Wert auf den Kauf von 3000 Litern bezieht. Entsprechend variiert der Preis, wenn Sie eine andere Menge Heiz\u00f6l erwerben.\n\nDie Daten in der folgenden Tabelle zeigen den Durchschnittspreis pro 100 Liter, wobei die Gebiete aller Postleitzahlen aus dem gesamten Stadtkreis zusammengefasst werden (zuletzt aktualisiert am 27.07.2023).\n\nUm die Kaufpreise f\u00fcr Heiz\u00f6l richtig einordnen zu k\u00f6nnen, lohnt sich immer ein Blick auf die Preisentwicklung. Die folgende Tabelle bietet Ihnen einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die Durchschnittspreise in Pforzheim des letzten Monats. Ausgegangen wird hier von einer gekauften Menge von 3000 Litern und angegeben ist der Preis f\u00fcr 100 Liter.\n\nDas Preisniveau von heute ist im Vergleich zum durchschnittlichen Preisniveau des letzten Jahres sehr niedrig. Derzeit funktioniert die Heiz\u00f6lbestellung relativ unproblematisch, wobei die Lieferfrist im Schnitt aktuell sogar geduldige 44 Arbeitstage in Pforzheim umfasst. Die Preisentwicklungen am Markt werden aktuell wieder st\u00e4rker von Verbrauchern beobachtet. Im Stadtkreis ist die Kaufaktivit\u00e4t aktuell hoch. Zusammenfassend l\u00e4sst sich entsprechend festhalten:\n\nIm Rahmen der massiven Kostenexplosionen im Energiebereich hat die Regierung auch f\u00fcr Heiz\u00f6l und Pellets Zuschussm\u00f6glichkeiten angek\u00fcndigt. Dies geschieht jedoch nicht automatisch, sondern muss \u00fcber Antragstellung erfolgen. Aktuell hei\u00dft es, dass dann pro Haushalt Hilfen von bis zu 2000 Euro ausgezahlt werden k\u00f6nnen. Zuschussberechtigt sind alle, die \u00fcber eine Rechnung nachweisen k\u00f6nnen, dass sich im Vergleich zum Vorjahreskauf der Preis mindestens verdoppelt hat. Kein Geld vom Staat gibt es allerdings, wenn das Heizkostenplus im Vergleich zum Vorjahr weniger als 100 Euro betr\u00e4gt.\n\nDer Antrag muss auf Bundesland-Ebene bei der entsprechenden Beh\u00f6rde gestellt werden. Die eidesstattliche Erkl\u00e4rung zur Richtigkeit der Brennstoffrechnung gibt bei einem Mietverh\u00e4ltnis der Mieter ab, an den auch die Entlastung weitergereicht werden muss. Vom Bund geplant sind insgesamt 1,8 Milliarden Euro f\u00fcr diese Entlastungsma\u00dfnahme. Es wird berichtet, dass aus den norddeutschen Bundesl\u00e4ndern Niedersachsen, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Hamburg, Bremen und Schleswig-Holstein bereits im April Hilfen beantragt werden k\u00f6nnen. Th\u00fcringen hingegen plant den Beginn der Antragsstellung Anfang Mai und in Berlin sind die Hilfen bereits verf\u00fcgbar. Um genaue Informationen zu erhalten, empfiehlt es sich, die Seiten des jeweiligen Landesministeriums zu besuchen. In den meisten F\u00e4llen ist entweder das Wirtschafts- oder das Sozialministerium zust\u00e4ndig.\n\nNeben dem \u00e4lteren Standard\u00f6l gibt es inzwischen auch schwefelarme Heiz\u00f6le sowie Bio- oder Premiumvarianten. H\u00f6herwertige \u00d6le k\u00f6nnen zwar von den Durchschnittspreisen abweichen und den Geldbeutel damit kurzfristig st\u00e4rker belasten, langfristig jedoch die Lebensdauer der Heizanlage positiv beeinflussen. Wenn Ihre Heizanlage einen gr\u00fcnen Deckel besitzt, sollten Sie ohnehin nur schwefelarme Heiz\u00f6le nutzen. Falls Sie auf Bio oder Premium wechseln wollen, sei jedoch dazu geraten, dies nur in Absprache mit einem Heizungsprofi oder dem Hersteller der Anlage zu realisieren.\n\nDie Ursache f\u00fcr die schwankenden Preise liegt abseits von wirtschaftspolitischen Entwicklungen und dem B\u00f6rsengeschehen auch im lokal unterschiedlichen Verbrauch. Der Studie des Bundesverbandes der Energie- und Wasserwirtschaft e.V. (BDEW) \"Wie heizt Deutschland?\" (2019) zufolge wird in Sachsen-Anhalt sowie den drei Stadtstaaten in weniger als 100.000 Wohngeb\u00e4uden mit \u00d6l geheizt, wohingegen es sich in Bayern, Nordrhein-Westfalen und Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg um mehr als eine Million handelt. Weiterhin spielt auch das Alter der Heizanlagen f\u00fcr den Verbrauch eine Rolle, die besonders im S\u00fcden des Landes in vielen F\u00e4llen \u00e4lter als 25 Jahre sind. Kein Wunder also, dass bei einer derart unterschiedlichen Nachfrage auch die Preisentwicklung betroffen ist - und das kann f\u00fcr viele sehr teuer werden. Wer sich allerdings gut auf seine Heiz\u00f6lbestellung vorbereitet und die Preise stets im Blick hat, kann dabei gewaltig sparen!\n\nIn der Bundesrepublik Deutschland liegt der Anteil in der BDEW-Studie f\u00fcr \u00d6l (Zentralheizung, \u00d6l\u00f6fen) in Wohngeb\u00e4uden bei 30,4%. Das bedeutet, dass hierzulande 5,8 Millionen Wohngeb\u00e4ude insgesamt mit Heiz\u00f6l versorgt werden m\u00fcssen. Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg geh\u00f6rt mit einer Million Wohngeb\u00e4uden, in denen mit \u00d6l geheizt wird und einen Anteil von 41,8% zu den gr\u00f6\u00dferen Heiz\u00f6l-Verbrauchern der Republik.\n\n1. Vermeiden Sie Notbestellungen: Wer zu lange mit der Bestellung wartet, sitzt entweder irgendwann im Kalten oder hat keine M\u00f6glichkeit mehr, zu einem guten Preis zu kaufen. Bestellen Sie deshalb rechtzeitig, so k\u00f6nnen Sie die Schwankungen beobachten und sich an einem Tag f\u00fcr den Kauf entscheiden, an dem der Preis g\u00fcnstig ist.\n\n2. Kooperieren Sie mit Familie, Nachbarn und Bekannten: Bei der Heiz\u00f6lbestellung kommt es nicht nur auf die tagesgenaue Preisentwicklung pro Liter an, sondern auch auf die Menge, die man kauft! Sprechen Sie mit Nachbarn, Familienmitgliedern und Bekannten ab, ob diese sich mit Ihnen vielleicht f\u00fcr eine Sammelbestellung zusammenschlie\u00dfen wollen. Dabei k\u00f6nnen alle Beteiligten nur profitieren!\n\n3. Verfolgen Sie den Heiz\u00f6l-Markt ganzj\u00e4hrig: Ein Blick in die Vergangenheit zeigt, dass sich besonders g\u00fcnstige Preise nicht auf eine bestimmte Zeit im Jahr zur\u00fcckf\u00fchren lassen. Neben dem Jahreszeit-bedingten Verbrauch spielen weltpolitische und weltwirtschaftliche Entwicklungen eine gro\u00dfe Rolle. Pr\u00fcfen Sie deshalb in regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Abst\u00e4nden \u00fcber das Jahr verteilt die Preise, um den richtigen Zeitraum nicht zu verpassen.\n\n4. Sparen Sie langfristig durch Modernisierung: Im Vergleich zu alten Modellen k\u00f6nnen moderne \u00d6l-Brennwertheizungen j\u00e4hrlich ein Einsparpotenzial im zweistelligen Prozentbereich bewirken. Die Umstellung auf andere Ressourcen erzielt dar\u00fcber hinaus sogar noch h\u00f6here Spar-Ertr\u00e4ge und wird zudem staatlich bezuschusst.\n\nDie Heiz\u00f6lpreise in diesem Artikel werden t\u00e4glich einmal aktualisiert (zuletzt am 27.07.2023 um 09.47 Uhr). Bitte beachten Sie, dass sich Preise im Verlauf des Tages ver\u00e4ndern k\u00f6nnen. Speichern Sie diese Webseite gern als Lesezeichen in Ihrem Browser ab, um \u00fcber die aktuellen Preisentwicklungen in Pforzheim informiert zu bleiben.\n\nEnergie ist als Thema nicht nur in aller Munde, sondern inzwischen auch eine Frage des Geldbeutels: Wenn Sie z.B. planen, von \u00d6l auf Gas umzustellen, erhalten Sie hier auf news.de auch spannende Informationen zum Gasverbrauch.",

        "title": "Heiz\u00f6lpreise Hochtaunuskreis aktuell: Die neuesten Entwicklungen am Heiz\u00f6l-Markt",
        "body": "Nicht erst seit dem Krieg in der Ukraine ver\u00e4ndert sich in Deutschland die Energiesituation und doch haben wir hier im vergangenen Jahr erstmals ausf\u00fchrlich \u00fcber Preise, Verbrauch und Einsparm\u00f6glichkeiten der deutschen Spitzen-Ressource Gas gesprochen. Weniger im Fokus stand dabei eine im Winter f\u00fcr viele Haushalte nach wie vor bedeutsame Energiequelle: das Heiz\u00f6l.\n\nHeiz\u00f6lpreise, Prognosen zur Preisentwicklung und Lieferzeiten schwanken in der Bundesrepublik stetig und unterscheiden sich nicht nur tagesaktuell, sondern auch regional sehr stark. In Hessen kosten 100 Liter durchschnittlich aktuell 99,30 Euro. Wie genau steht es im Hochtaunuskreis um den Heiz\u00f6l-Preis und welche aktuellen Lieferfristen gibt es?\n\nWenn Sie heute Heiz\u00f6l kaufen, bezahlen Sie im Durchschnitt im Hochtaunuskreis f\u00fcr 100 Liter 97,85 Euro. Damit liegt der Preis im Hochtaunuskreis unter dem Durchschnitt von Hessen. Beachten Sie, dass sich dieser Wert auf den Kauf von 3000 Litern bezieht. Entsprechend variiert der Preis, wenn Sie eine andere Menge Heiz\u00f6l erwerben.\n\nDie Daten in der folgenden Tabelle zeigen den Durchschnittspreis pro 100 Liter, wobei die Gebiete aller Postleitzahlen aus dem gesamten Landkreis zusammengefasst werden (zuletzt aktualisiert am 27.07.2023).\n\nQuelle: heizoel24.de\n\nUm die Kaufpreise f\u00fcr Heiz\u00f6l richtig einordnen zu k\u00f6nnen, lohnt sich immer ein Blick auf die Preisentwicklung. Die folgende Tabelle bietet Ihnen einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die Durchschnittspreise im Hochtaunuskreis des letzten Monats. Ausgegangen wird hier von einer gekauften Menge von 3000 Litern und angegeben ist der Preis f\u00fcr 100 Liter.\n\nDas Preisniveau von heute ist im Vergleich zum durchschnittlichen Preisniveau des letzten Jahres sehr niedrig. Derzeit funktioniert die Heiz\u00f6lbestellung relativ unproblematisch, wobei die Lieferfrist im Hochtaunuskreis im Schnitt aktuell 24 Arbeitstage umfasst. Die Preisentwicklungen am Markt werden aktuell wieder st\u00e4rker von Verbrauchern beobachtet. Im Landkreis ist die Kaufaktivit\u00e4t aktuell sehr hoch. Zusammenfassend l\u00e4sst sich entsprechend festhalten:\n\nIm Rahmen der massiven Kostenexplosionen im Energiebereich hat die Regierung auch f\u00fcr Heiz\u00f6l und Pellets Zuschussm\u00f6glichkeiten angek\u00fcndigt. Dies geschieht jedoch nicht automatisch, sondern muss \u00fcber Antragstellung erfolgen. Aktuell hei\u00dft es, dass dann pro Haushalt Hilfen von bis zu 2000 Euro ausgezahlt werden k\u00f6nnen. Zuschussberechtigt sind alle, die \u00fcber eine Rechnung nachweisen k\u00f6nnen, dass sich im Vergleich zum Vorjahreskauf der Preis mindestens verdoppelt hat. Kein Geld vom Staat gibt es allerdings, wenn das Heizkostenplus im Vergleich zum Vorjahr weniger als 100 Euro betr\u00e4gt.\n\nDer Antrag muss auf Bundesland-Ebene bei der entsprechenden Beh\u00f6rde gestellt werden. Die eidesstattliche Erkl\u00e4rung zur Richtigkeit der Brennstoffrechnung gibt bei einem Mietverh\u00e4ltnis der Mieter ab, an den auch die Entlastung weitergereicht werden muss. Vom Bund geplant sind insgesamt 1,8 Milliarden Euro f\u00fcr diese Entlastungsma\u00dfnahme. Es wird berichtet, dass aus den norddeutschen Bundesl\u00e4ndern Niedersachsen, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Hamburg, Bremen und Schleswig-Holstein bereits im April Hilfen beantragt werden k\u00f6nnen. Th\u00fcringen hingegen plant den Beginn der Antragsstellung Anfang Mai und in Berlin sind die Hilfen bereits verf\u00fcgbar. Um genaue Informationen zu erhalten, empfiehlt es sich, die Seiten des jeweiligen Landesministeriums zu besuchen. In den meisten F\u00e4llen ist entweder das Wirtschafts- oder das Sozialministerium zust\u00e4ndig.\n\nNeben dem \u00e4lteren Standard\u00f6l gibt es inzwischen auch schwefelarme Heiz\u00f6le sowie Bio- oder Premiumvarianten. H\u00f6herwertige \u00d6le k\u00f6nnen zwar von den Durchschnittspreisen abweichen und den Geldbeutel damit kurzfristig st\u00e4rker belasten, langfristig jedoch die Lebensdauer der Heizanlage positiv beeinflussen. Wenn Ihre Heizanlage einen gr\u00fcnen Deckel besitzt, sollten Sie ohnehin nur schwefelarme Heiz\u00f6le nutzen. Falls Sie auf Bio oder Premium wechseln wollen, sei jedoch dazu geraten, dies nur in Absprache mit einem Heizungsprofi oder dem Hersteller der Anlage zu realisieren.\n\nDie Ursache f\u00fcr die schwankenden Preise liegt abseits von wirtschaftspolitischen Entwicklungen und dem B\u00f6rsengeschehen auch im lokal unterschiedlichen Verbrauch. Der Studie des Bundesverbandes der Energie- und Wasserwirtschaft e.V. (BDEW) \"Wie heizt Deutschland?\" (2019) zufolge wird in den drei Stadtstaaten sowie in Sachsen-Anhalt in weniger als 100.000 Wohngeb\u00e4uden mit \u00d6l geheizt, wohingegen es sich in Nordrhein-Westfalen, Bayern und Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg um mehr als eine Million handelt. Weiterhin spielt auch das Alter der Heizanlagen f\u00fcr den Verbrauch eine Rolle, die besonders im S\u00fcden des Landes in vielen F\u00e4llen \u00e4lter als 25 Jahre sind. So wundert es kaum, dass bei einer derart unterschiedlichen Nachfrage auch die Preisentwicklung betroffen ist - und das kann f\u00fcr viele sehr teuer werden. Wer sich allerdings gut auf seine Heiz\u00f6lbestellung vorbereitet und die Preise stets im Blick hat, kann dabei gewaltig sparen!\n\nIn der Bundesrepublik Deutschland liegt der Anteil in der BDEW-Studie f\u00fcr \u00d6l (Zentralheizung, \u00d6l\u00f6fen) in Wohngeb\u00e4uden bei 30,4%. Das meint, dass hierzulande 5,8 Millionen Wohngeb\u00e4ude insgesamt mit Heiz\u00f6l versorgt werden m\u00fcssen. Mit 40% an mit \u00d6l beheizten Wohngeb\u00e4uden geh\u00f6rt Hessen zu den Bundesl\u00e4ndern mit einem starken Verbrauch. Immerhin 0,6 Millionen Wohngeb\u00e4ude nutzen hier weiterhin Heiz\u00f6l.\n\n1. Vermeiden Sie Notbestellungen: Wer zu lange mit der Bestellung wartet, sitzt entweder irgendwann im Kalten oder hat keine M\u00f6glichkeit mehr, zu einem guten Preis zu kaufen. Bestellen Sie deshalb rechtzeitig, so k\u00f6nnen Sie die Schwankungen beobachten und sich an einem Tag f\u00fcr den Kauf entscheiden, an dem der Preis g\u00fcnstig ist.\n\n2. Kooperieren Sie mit Familie, Nachbarn und Bekannten: Bei der Heiz\u00f6lbestellung kommt es nicht nur auf die tagesgenaue Preisentwicklung pro Liter an, sondern auch auf die Menge, die man kauft! Sprechen Sie mit Nachbarn, Familienmitgliedern und Bekannten ab, ob diese sich mit Ihnen vielleicht f\u00fcr eine Sammelbestellung zusammenschlie\u00dfen wollen. Dabei k\u00f6nnen alle Beteiligten nur profitieren!\n\n3. Verfolgen Sie den Heiz\u00f6l-Markt ganzj\u00e4hrig: Ein Blick in die Vergangenheit zeigt, dass sich besonders g\u00fcnstige Preise nicht auf eine bestimmte Zeit im Jahr zur\u00fcckf\u00fchren lassen. Neben dem Jahreszeit-bedingten Verbrauch spielen weltpolitische und weltwirtschaftliche Entwicklungen eine gro\u00dfe Rolle. Pr\u00fcfen Sie deshalb in regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Abst\u00e4nden \u00fcber das Jahr verteilt die Preise, um den richtigen Zeitraum nicht zu verpassen.\n\n4. Sparen Sie langfristig durch Modernisierung: Im Vergleich zu alten Modellen k\u00f6nnen moderne \u00d6l-Brennwertheizungen j\u00e4hrlich ein Einsparpotenzial im zweistelligen Prozentbereich bewirken. Die Umstellung auf andere Ressourcen erzielt dar\u00fcber hinaus sogar noch h\u00f6here Spar-Ertr\u00e4ge und wird zudem staatlich bezuschusst.\n\nDie Heiz\u00f6lpreise in diesem Artikel werden t\u00e4glich einmal aktualisiert (zuletzt am 27.07.2023 um 09.49 Uhr). Bitte beachten Sie, dass sich Preise im Verlauf des Tages ver\u00e4ndern k\u00f6nnen. Speichern Sie diese Webseite gern als Lesezeichen in Ihrem Browser ab, um \u00fcber die aktuellen Preisentwicklungen im Hochtaunuskreis informiert zu bleiben.\n\nEnergie ist als Thema nicht nur in aller Munde, sondern inzwischen auch eine Frage des Geldbeutels: Wenn Sie z.B. planen, von \u00d6l auf Gas umzustellen, erhalten Sie hier auf news.de auch spannende Informationen zum Gasverbrauch.",

Hay 17 personas detenidas en Melilla (11) y Granada (6) -entre las que se encuentran responsables y jugadores de un equipo de f\u00fatbol de la 3\u00aa divisi\u00f3n RFEF- por la presunta comisi\u00f3n de los delitos de pertenencia a organizaci\u00f3n criminal, corrupci\u00f3n entre particulares en el \u00e1mbito deportivo, estafa, blanqueo de capitales y falsedad documental.\n\nLos agentes, fruto de los registros realizados en una agencia de viajes de la ciudad de Melilla y en la Real Federaci\u00f3n Melillense de F\u00fatbol, han intervenido numerosa documentaci\u00f3n y dispositivos electr\u00f3nicos relacionados con los hechos investigados. Por otra parte, la colaboraci\u00f3n del Servicio de Investigaci\u00f3n Global del Mercado de Apuestas (SIGMA) ha resultado determinante.\n\nLa investigaci\u00f3n se inici\u00f3 el pasado mes de febrero cuando la Direcci\u00f3n General de Ordenaci\u00f3n del Juego, dependiente del Ministerio de Consumo, puso en conocimiento de los agentes la existencia de varias alertas recibidas de diferentes casas de apuestas online. \u00c9stas informaban de las sospechas sobre m\u00faltiples apuestas realizadas desde Melilla a resultados concretos de partidos de f\u00fatbol disputados por un equipo de la ciudad aut\u00f3noma.\n\nDe forma paralela, LALIGA inform\u00f3 de una comunicaci\u00f3n an\u00f3nima recibida a trav\u00e9s de su canal de denuncias, en la que alertaban sobre pr\u00e1cticas sospechosas de ese mismo equipo de f\u00fatbol relacionadas con ama\u00f1os deportivos, as\u00ed como con irregularidades en el cobro de ayudas y subvenciones cuyo dinero se destinaba a realizar apuestas deportivas.\n\nEl presidente del equipo de gestionaba los ama\u00f1os haciendo part\u00edcipes a jugadores de su confianza. Una vez recibida y analizada la informaci\u00f3n, los agentes identificaron un complejo entramado criminal evidenciando que el propiopresidente del equipo, haciendo part\u00edcipe a jugadores de su confianza, era quien presuntamente gestionaba los ama\u00f1os deportivos. Los jugadores, adem\u00e1s, se val\u00edan de terceras personas de su entorno para materializar las apuestas y evitar as\u00ed servinculados con las apuestas realizadas y los partidos disputados.\n\nLa investigaci\u00f3n se centr\u00f3 en los partidos disputados en el \u00faltimo tramo de la competici\u00f3n -una vez consumado el descenso del equipo investigado-,momento en el que las casas de apuestas alertaron de la recepci\u00f3n de una gran cantidad de apuestas a resultados concretos, o a resultados muy abultados, con la ciudad de Melilla como epicentro de las mismas.\n\nPor otra parte, las gestiones policiales practicadas han acreditado que el mismo club deportivo ha sido beneficiario de subvenciones utilizadas previsiblemente de forma fraudulenta con las que aumentaban los importes a cobrar.\n\nLa colaboraci\u00f3n del Servicio de Investigaci\u00f3n Global del Mercado de Apuestas (SIGMA) ha resultado determinante para esclarecer los hechos. Asimismo, EUROPOL ha participado activamente en la explotaci\u00f3n de la operaci\u00f3n, a trav\u00e9s de una oficina m\u00f3vil desplegada en la ciudad de Melilla, con tareas operativas de extracci\u00f3n de informaci\u00f3n de los dispositivos electr\u00f3nicos y los terminales telef\u00f3nicos.\n\nFinalmente, la operaci\u00f3n ha permitido arrestar a 17 personas -11 en la ciudad aut\u00f3noma de Melilla y 6 en Granada- vinculadas al club deportivoinvestigado as\u00ed como a otros equipos con los que se enfrent\u00f3.\n\nLa operaci\u00f3n contin\u00faa abierta.

        "title": "UN Charter and Delta state Born Physically Challenged 'Keke' Operator In Lagos | Latest Nigeria News Today",
        "body": "Acting on a recent emotional words and compassionate description by a professional colleague of one resourceful 32 years old Mr. Gift Captain Tonmene, a Delta state born but Lagos based physically challenged tricycle (Keke) operator in Mile 12 area of the state, I took a trip in the evening of Monday July 2023 to Mile 12 Motor Park, Lagos, to ascertain my friend's narrative.\n\nAside from coming face to face with the man in question which of course satisfied my journalist instinct for social justice as well as nourished my curiosity for bringing to the surface, societal ills to where they could be seen and addressed, my conversation with him on the other hand, was more revealing than expected.\n\nFirst, separate from consolidating the belief by Nigerians with critical minds that neglect of physically challenged and other vulnerable Nigerians by those in the position of authority has finally become a reality all Nigerians of good will must worry about, the 'meeting' gave further fillip to how poverty and deprivation have undeniably scarred our nation, dirtied our honour and diminished our pride as a nation.\n\nSpeaking on that day, at time and in that place, the 32 years old Tonmene, who was seated in his tricycle explained that he is married and blessed with a child. He is of Ijaw ethnic nationality and hails precisely from Tuomo in Burutu Local Government Area of Delta state.\n\nTragically unique was his revelation that he got crippled at the age of two under a mysterious circumstance.\n\nAccording to him, he started walking like every other normal child of his age when he was a year old but got crippled to the consternation of his relations at age two while in his sleep one fateful night. He lamented that the mystery surrounding that unusual and unnatural occurrence is yet to be unmasked 30 years after.\n\nAsked if he is fulfilled as Keke operator, the Ijaw born Tonmene stressed that operating a tricycle as a means of livelihood, to him could be likened to taking a fish out of water, insisting that if given needed support, he would switch to a more structured business like sales of Tricycle parts which he had earlier underwent apprenticeship for three years.\n\nTonmene further stated that he detests the act of begging for survival and that informed his decision to become Keke operator. He, however, lamented that operating a tricycle with his current physical state is laced with a lot of stress, frustration and hazards.\n\n'Each time the tricycle suddenly breaks down, i live at the mercy of passer byes as i can neither push nor single handedly rectify the challenge\"\n\nWhile he argued that he took to riding tricycle because 'preferable was not available', the Ijaw born Captain submitted that if given the needed financial support, he will abandon Keke for his first 'love' which is the sales of tricycle parts as that will avail him more profit while providing needed comfort to his young family.\n\nIn his words, I believe in the dignity of labour and that is why I cannot be a beggar. I don't have the capacity to beg and that is more reason why I want to work and feed my family. If I am given the necessary financial support needed to establish the business that I learnt (sales of tricycle parts), I will definitely leave Keke and invest in that business. I am sure that I will excel and most importantly, doing the business will provide me and my family the needed comfort and take effective care of our financial demands''.\n\nI lived in Bayelsa state for some years before I decided to come to Lagos to seek my daily bread. I like Lagos and if I am assisted, I will establish my business here in Lagos. Sanwolu is a good man. Delta state Governor, my governor is equally a good man. I know they will assist me. He said.\n\nContinuing, Captain pointed out that he never considered his condition a disability or allowed it to stop him from achieving his set objectives in life. This fact, according to him, explains why he crawled without clutches to the school all through his primary and secondary school days until he was given clutches in 2010 by good spirited individuals.\n\nWhile he observes that the harsh economic situation was made worse by the fact that his wife is presently unemployed, Tonmene decried, a situation where he has to pay one thousand three hundred naira (N1300) on daily basis as levies to different authorities and task forces in the state before he could be allowed to operate his tricycle in Lagos state. He however appreciated the Chairman, Tricycle Operators Association in the locality, whom he said gave him a waiver to be paying only N1300, while other operators pay far more.\n\nHe, therefore, called on Lagos state he called on the Executive Governor of Lagos state, Mr. Babajide Sanwolu, his Delta state and Bayelsa counterpart, Rt Honourable Elder Sheriff Oborevwori, well meaning Ijaw brothers and sisters, religious bodies, corporate organizations, Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) within and out Nigeria to urgently come to his rescue in his present time of need.\n\nFor me, while Tonmene call is understandable and appreciated, it is my view that it is our collective responsibility to look out for one another and perform the responsibility of care at the most fundamental levels.\n\nAnd, if nothing is done by both state and Federal Governments to save and serve Tonmene and other disabled Nigerians, it will again confirm as true the age long argument that ' the most stubborn refusal to admit the need for change in Nigeria is always coming from the very people who are running the country and it will be pretty tough to any form of positive progress in the country if such 'culture' is left unaddressed.\n\nAgain, what troubles me in addition to the above concern is that Nigeria is a long standing member of various organs of the United Nation and on the issue of human rights of persons with disabilities at the international level, the United Nations Charter affirms the essentiality of \"a universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction\".\n\nGoing by reports, the rights of individuals with disabilities are grounded in a human rights framework based on the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, international covenants on human rights and related human rights instruments.\n\nPersons with disabilities, the report added, are entitled to exercise their civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights on an equal basis with others under all the international treaties. The full participation of persons with disabilities benefits society as their individual contributions enrich all spheres of life and this is an integral part of individual's and society's well-being and progress for a society for all - with or without disabilities.\n\nIn a similar vein, the rights of individuals with disabilities have in another report, been addressed more generally throughout the development of the international human rights law. The principle of the right to equality, addressed throughout the normative standards set out by the international human rights instruments, is the foundation of the rights of individuals with disabilities. In order that the rights of persons with disabilities may be further realized, contemporary international law has increasingly recognized the need for all states to incorporate human rights standards into their national legislation.\n\nTo win, this piece calls on Federal Government and affected states to choose the best means to promote full realization of economic, social and cultural rights of Mr. Gift Captain Tonmene and other persons with disabilities in Nigeria particularly as there is no country exempted from the need for improved policies and laws for individuals with disabilities.",

Despr\u00e9s del debat en pon\u00e8ncia i comissi\u00f3, aquest dijous ha arribat al ple, on ha tirat endavant amb 113 vots a favor, del PSC, ERC, Junts, la CUP, els comuns i el PP. Nom\u00e9s l'extrema dreta de Vox s'hi ha oposat, mentre Ciutadans i el diputat no adscrit Antonio Gallego s'han abstingut.\n\nA m\u00e9s d'augmentar les indemnitzacions, la iniciativa tamb\u00e9 inclou mesures perqu\u00e8 l'autor o inductor de viol\u00e8ncia masclista no pugui administrar les indemnitzacions per als fills menors d'edat, amb la suspensi\u00f3 cautelar del pagament de les ajudes fins que no compleixin els 18 anys.\n\nEn defensa de la iniciativa, la diputada del PSC Beatriz Silva ha assegurat que \"els feminicidis s\u00f3n la forma m\u00e9s extrema de la viol\u00e8ncia masclista\", \"l'expressi\u00f3 m\u00e9s dram\u00e0tica de la desigualtat entre homes i dones\" i \"l'expressi\u00f3 d'un terror que soscava la democr\u00e0cia\". En aquest sentit, la parlament\u00e0ria socialista ha defensat que \"dedicar recursos hauria de ser una prioritat de totes les administracions\", tamb\u00e9 de la Generalitat, i ha assegurat que aquesta reforma \"permetr\u00e0 un acc\u00e9s efectiu\" a aquestes ajudes, que s'augmenten \"de forma significativa\".\n\nNom\u00e9s Vox en contra\n\nLa reforma de les ajudes a les v\u00edctimes de viol\u00e8ncia masclista i vic\u00e0ria ha comptat amb un suport pr\u00e0cticament un\u00e0nime de la cambra catalana, amb l'\u00fanica excepci\u00f3 de Vox. La diputada d'extrema dreta M\u00f2nica Lora ha denunciat la \"crueltat de la ideologia de g\u00e8nere\" i que \"aquesta i altres lleis s\u00f3n retrocessos per a la igualtat entre homes i dones\". Davant d'una llei que parla de la p\u00e8rdua de la mare, Lora ha preguntat: \"I la p\u00e8rdua d'un pare? Fins aquest punt els fa arribar el seu fanatisme\".",

        "body": "Noronex to extend footprint over Kalahari Copper BeltDoug BrightSponsoredThu, 27 July 2023 4:53PM\n\nNoronex is seeking to extend its Kalahari Copper Belt footprint after lodging two new full permit applications over 1650 square kilometres of prospective ground at the eastern extremity of its granted and fully-owned Humpback project area in Namibia.\n\nThe applications are adjacent to the Namibia-Botswana border and the southern boundary of Humpback and will bring the company's exploration portfolio area in Namibia to about 8700sq km, including about 3500sq km of permits under application.\n\nNoronex's growing portfolio embraces the highly-prospective, but relatively underexplored, transnational Kalahari Copper Belt, which runs north-east from central Namibia to north-eastern Botswana.\n\nMost significantly, it takes in a massive 300km strike of the sheared contact between the Ngwana Pan Formation and the overlying Lower D'Kar Formation (the NPF-D'Kar contact) that has long been recognised as a key contact zone hosting copper and silver mineralisation throughout the Kalahari Copper Belt.\n\nThe application area has been explored previously, most recently by Kopore Metals and Sandfire Resources. The companies drilled several holes and flew airborne magnetic and electromagnetic (EM) surveys, while other prior exploration was also undertaken by EISEB Exploration and Mining in a joint venture with Cupric Canyon and Antofagasta.\n\nAbout 50 holes were drilled by past explorers within the new application area. Between 2012 and 2013, exploration by EISEB defined several regional targets, which it tested by reverse-circulation (RC) and diamond drilling.\n\nEISEB drilled 32 holes in the application area and hit encouraging copper intercepts along the key NPF-D'Kar contact, including separate sections in four holes of 11m at 0.54 per cent copper from 152m, 2m at 0.84 per cent from 180m, 5.4m at 0.59 per cent from 219m and 8.7m at 0.41 per cent from 275m. It further confirmed that the NPF-D'Kar contact prospectivity was developed on or associated with known and partly-mapped antiformal or domal structures.\n\nThe new permit applications come hard on the heels of Noronex's recent contract signing to kick off its maiden 4000m RC drilling program by the end of the month to test its copper-silver exploration targets at both its Blowhole and Fiesta prospects within Humpback.\n\nBlowhole is about 10km north of the new ground and less than 10km west of the Botswana border. Aeromagnetic surveys confirm Blowhole's direct strike continuity with the same sheared antiformal D'Kar-NPF contact that hosts mineralisation at Cobre's Ngami and Thul prospects, which are less than 100km to the north-east. Cobre has reported several encouraging intersections from the site, including 10.7m at 1.3 per cent copper under shallow cover.\n\nNoronex says it plans to drill five holes at Blowhole - the first ever put into the prospect.\n\nFiesta is about 130km south-west along strike from Blowhole and lies on the western closure of a domal structure on the prospective NPF-D'Kar contact. Anomalous drill intercepts at Fiesta have hallmarks of the deposits defined in Botswana over 400km to the east, including Cupric Canyon's Zone 5 project which holds 167 million tonnes at 2 per cent copper.\n\nConsidering the likely two-year approval process, Noronex's new applications seem well-timed strategically, with the Kalahari Copper Belt coming under increasing attention from explorers and good ground being rapidly snapped up.\n\nGiven the company's recently-granted tenure and new application areas at Humpback, combined with ongoing exploration at its Witvlei copper project and the domal structure on its Snowball joint venture, there appears to be plenty of work to keep it occupied.\n\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

HT has reviewed a copy of the report.\n\nThe committee was constituted by the green panel in January this year to conduct a study on the status of the carrying capacity of Mussoorie.\n\nThe status report has recommended that the expansion of construction activities should be avoided, and proper drainage and sewage systems need to be implemented in Mussoorie.\n\nThe committee has recommended that the registration of tourists should be done according to the carrying capacity of the area, especially the available parking space, guest room availability, among others.\n\nAlso Read:Rush at hills an invitation for virus to spread, warns Centre\n\n\"Tourists can be charged for visiting the Mussoorie area and the payment can be utilised for managing waste and cleanliness\", the report said.\n\nOn February 2, principal bench of NGT, while taking suo motu cognisance of a media report warning Joshimath-like situation in Mussoorie, had directed the Uttarakhand government to conduct a study of the carrying capacity of Mussoorie and formed a nine-member committee to suggest remedial measures for preventing environmental damage to the hill station.\n\nThe committee headed by the chief secretary, Uttarakhand, included representatives from the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology Dehradun; Govind Ballabh Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment, Almora, National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee, Kumaon University, Nainital, Space Application Centre, Ahmedabad and National Institute of Rock Mechanics, Bengaluru.\n\nThe report states that \"72.57% of the area in Mussoorie comes under forests and attracts the provisions of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The land under agriculture however has reduced on account of building construction. The population growth, increase in tourist in-flow has resulted in increased demand for water supply and requirement of sewage system and waste management\".\n\nThe committee has listed preventive and remedial measures that need to be undertaken for better planning and management of available resources in Mussoorie.\n\nFor tunnel and major civil structures projects like hotels and hospitals, the committee has suggested that detailed engineering geological and geotechnical investigations should be done according to BIS Codes and construction permission should only be granted after clearance of the report from the State/Centre appointed statutory body.\n\nAfter proper examination of existing buildings, the committee stated it may be necessary to strengthen the retrofitting of structures to prevent them from sliding or collapsing.\n\n\"This could involve underpinning or adding reinforcement to the foundations. Technical auditing of multi-story buildings (above three storeys) by experts on an annual or biennial basis can be conducted to know the health of the buildings.\n\nWhen repairing roads or building structures, the committee has recommended that the boulders should not be removed by digging or blasting the hillsides.\n\n\"In landslide-prone areas, stones and boulders should not be removed from the bottom of the hill because this would remove toe support, increasing the likelihood of landslides. It is necessary to fill in any cracks that have appeared on the slopes\", the report stated.\n\nThe committee has stressed the need for an effective drainage system in the hill town.\n\n\"Due to the lack of proper surface draining system, the rainwater of most of the buildings is being infiltrated into the ground which generates sub-surface flow and accelerates the process of land creeping resulting in damage to buildings and other properties causing economic and environmental disruptions\", the report said.\n\nThe committee has also suggested that phytoremediation (using plants to clean up the soil, air, and water that have been contaminated by chemicals) of degraded slopes can be initiated, which can help to anchor the soil and prevent erosion.\n\n\"Broad-leaved native trees can be promoted for stabilizing slopes, especially in the landslide-prone areas\", it said.\n\nThe committee has also suggested that recharge/rejuvenation of natural springs should be explored with scientific intervention.\n\n\"Natural springs in the region should be monitored and recharge activities (proper plantation) can be initiated on proper scientific basis. Springs (act as natural piezometers) are good indicators for any change in the groundwater in the mountainous area. Therefore, there is an urgent need to inventories all springs located in the vicinity/periphery of Mussoorie towns. Their periodic monitoring may be a good tool for detecting any natural calamities events in advance in the mountainous regions\", the report stated.\n\nThe committee has also recommended that rooftop rainwater harvesting can be promoted to meet the deficit water demand, at least during the peak tourist period.\n\n\"Open rainwater seepage must be stopped through the construction of a pucca drainage system. Water should not be allowed to accumulate in any depression; instead, drains should be built to transport it to safe areas. A proper sewerage network and appropriate treatment facilities should be ensured. The sewage water should not be allowed to percolate or connect with natural ground water. The feasibility of reuse of treated water for secondary uses can be explored\", the report said.\n\nThe report emphasised that the construction of new buildings is already restricted in Mussoorie, and such new/additional construction-related extension work should be properly monitored.\n\n\"All the building foundations should be mapped by a competent engineering geologist to know about the safe bearing capacity of the foundation and treatment of cut slope. In consultation with the designer, type of foundation (footing, strip, raft) and height of building can be finalised. Then only after this, the map can be submitted to MDDA (Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority) for approval.\n\nThe report also pointed out that the regulations related to waste management should be strictly followed.\n\n\"Dumping sites around water bodies should be strictly restricted to prevent pollution threats on the important sources of drinking water of the city. A QR code based Digital Direct Refund System should be implemented for management of plastic waste. Strict measures should be made to promote the usage of biodegradable materials and the ban on use of Single Use Plastics (SUPs) items should be strictly enforced\".\n\nFor better traffic management, the committee has suggested that the total number of permissible vehicles should not exceed the capacity of parking facilities available.",

The foundation is caring for orphans as part of a reintroduction program that will monitor their progress for over a decade. The foundation is partnering with Colossal on an extensive data-gathering operation, using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze the animals' behavior and pair it with genomic data on each elephant. \"We'll be able to mix the art of the elephant handlers with the science of today,\" argues Matt James, chief animal officer at Colossal. The AI will be fed video footage which has been interpreted by elephant handlers, so that over time it can learn about social behaviors and leadership models, for example. Colossal is also sequencing the genomes of Elephant Havens' orphans to conduct a gene-trait analysis of individuals, to see how their genetic information might be expressed in their behavior.",

        "body": "KOTA KINABALU (July 27): The state government has established a special Cabinet committee to address the issue of Self-Sufficiency Level (SSL) in the state.\n\nChief Minister Datuk Seri Panglima Hajiji Noor said the special committee would be headed by the state Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Industry (MAFFI).\n\n\"I am proud of the persistent efforts of MAFFI and the agencies under it as well as the Federal Government agencies that have united their efforts to achieve the goal of increasing the SSL production of all types of food in this state.\n\n\"Among the issues identified, related to the area of paddy fields that is getting smaller and smaller because it has been used for residential development and commercial shops.\n\nTo deal with this issue, the government has explored a new rice planting area in Trusan Sapi, Beluran covering about 2,000 acres.\n\n\"It is promoted in an integrated manner by MAFFI and its agencies, which are the Rural Development Corporation (KPD), the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Irrigation and Drainage with the involvement of the private sector and the people of Trusan Sapi as participants in rice planting,\" he said when officiating the state-level Farmers, Breeders and Fishermen's Day 2023 at Wisma Pertanian here on Thursday.\n\nThe text of his speech was read by Deputy Chief Minister I Datuk Seri Panglima Dr Jeffrey G Kitingan who is also the state Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Industry.\n\nThe Chief Minister said all the efforts taken by this government is to ensure sufficient food supply and produce more high-value agricultural products for commercial purposes that can stimulate the growth of the sector.\n\n\"The agriculture, fisheries and animal husbandry sectors have enormous potential to continue to be developed in this state.\n\n\"Emphasis is on value chain activities as a whole, namely increased production, collection of produce, more systematic processing and marketing as well as the use of the latest technology to guarantee sufficient food supply and the expansion of the export market abroad,\" he said.\n\nIn this regard, he said for the crop sub-sector, a total of RM115.39 million was allocated to the Agriculture Department to increase the production of various crops, to generate income for farmers from RM2,000 to RM4,000 per month.\n\n\"The government's efforts to help the B40 target group and the extreme poor will continue through the Rural Development Corporation with an allocation of RM20.28 million. A total of 2,015 participants will receive benefits from the implementation of various livestock and crop programs.\n\n\"In addition, KPD Smart System has been developed and will be used in KPD agricultural produce collection centers. In the fisheries sub-sector, the state government through the Department of Fisheries, Ko-Nelayan and SAFMA among others, will continue to implement various initiatives to guarantee sufficient fisheries supply in the state.\n\n\"Among them, encouraging young fishermen to farm fish in cages, cultivating seaweed, including exploring the downstream industry of processing fishery products by producing products such as Keropok Amplang,\" he added.\n\nHe further explained that a total of RM46.09 million was allocated to the Fisheries Department, this year, to continue various programs to guarantee the production of sustainable fishery products to cover the domestic and international markets.\n\n\"While for the livestock sector, Sabah still imports beef, goat meat, dairy products, chicken products and eggs. However, efforts are being made by the Sabah Veterinary Services Department through the Sabah Ruminant Industry Strengthening Project which is worth RM50 million.\n\n\"The department also cooperates with several GLCs through projects such as the Livestock Integration Project under Palm Oil (PINTAR), the Goat Livestock Project and the Livestock Transformation Program,\" he said.",

        "title": "Mawrth Vallis region - the deepest clay deposits on Mars",
        "body": "Enormous Martian valley once again the focus for HRSC\n\nOn 18 February 2023, Mars Express made a repeat flyover of the Mawrth Vallis region, one of the most distinctive and fascinating regions of the Red Planet, which is also of the greatest scientific interest. 'Mawrth' is the Welsh name for Mars. The image data were acquired 130 kilometres west of the outflow of Mawrth Vallis. Repeated imaging coverage at different times makes it possible to observe changes on the surface of Mars.\n\nOften, clouds or dust in the atmosphere cause variations in image quality, especially in this region at the transition between the southern highland regions and the northern lowlands of Mars, referred to as the highland-lowland or dichotomy boundary. Another reason for repeat observations is to obtain additional surface data for creating and improving terrain models and image mosaics. A large mosaic of this region was created in 2016, as was an animation showing an overflight of the region.\n\nScience fiction fans also know Mawrth Vallis as the location of the more than one-thousand-kilometre route followed by astronaut Mark Watney while stranded on Mars, in the novel 'The Martian' by Andy Weir. This book was later also filmed. In the end, Watney reached the rescue rocket Ares 4 in Schiaparelli Crater, which is located a little further southeast in Arabia Terra. In 2015, the DLR Institute of Planetary Research recreated this route with HRSC image data and computed a spectacular animation using digital terrain models derived from HRSC data. This video was shown in German-language cinemas as the opening credits to 'The Martian'.\n\nWas Mawrth Vallis once a place suitable for life?\n\nAlthough the region is considered one of the most promising locations to search for fossil or even present-day life on the Red Planet, it has not yet been selected as the landing site for a mission due to its difficult topography, as landings on steep terrain are hazardous. Light and dark coloured deposits are found in and around the Mawrth Vallis outflow. The light-coloured materials in particular are an indication of the previous presence of water. The largest deposits of hydrous phyllosilicates on Mars exist in and near Mawrth Vallis, forming deposits up to 200 metres deep in some places.\n\nOn Earth, such clay minerals often form as a weathering product of volcanic rocks that come into contact with water over long periods of time and are thus transformed. Therefore, an analogous formation process for these minerals is thought to have taken place on Mars. Spectrometer data were used to identify, among others, the smectite clay minerals nontronite and saponite, in whose crystal framework of silicon tetrahedra, in addition to aluminium and magnesium cations, 'water molecules' (hydroxyl ions, OH-) are also 'incorporated'.\n\nAbove the clays lies a dark stratum of rock that is thought to be of volcanic origin. Investigations with the Observatoire pour la Mineralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activite (OMEGA) spectrometer, also carried on board Mars Express, led to a better understanding of the iron-, magnesium- and aluminium-rich clay minerals. The different compositions of these clays testify to the different ages and degrees of weathering of the individual deposits. Sulphate-bearing deposits were also found on the floor of Mawrth Vallis, again indicating a different formation environment.\n\nIn addition to mineralogy, the large-scale stratification of the light-coloured rocks offers a unique opportunity to decipher the depositional conditions and the climatic history of Mars. The layered silicates on Mars could indicate surface weathering as a result of the action of water and therefore an environment that was potentially suitable for life in the past. Water once flowed through Mawrth Vallis and probably shaped the surface until 3.6 billion years ago. It is therefore possible that fossil traces of microbes have been preserved in the rocks, having been protected from destruction by radiation and erosion by the overlying rock layers. Astrobiologists have long been interested in this region of Mars.\n\nDiverse landscape structures and a 'muddy' impact\n\nThe 25-kilometre-wide impact crater on the far left in images 1, 6 and 7 has a depression or pit in its centre, whose northern wall has partially collapsed. Such 'central pit craters' are impact craters that often occur on Mars, due to its subsurface ice layers, and on ice-rich moons. The raised rims around the central pit strongly suggest that it was formed by a water vapour explosion.\n\nFurther to the right (north) in the images are large areas of light-coloured, clay-like materials. On closer inspection, they can also be found within the crater walls, for example in the smaller crater in the lower part of the images. The dark, volcanic overlying rock can also be seen in places, but is often heavily eroded. Further north, the terrain drops steeply, by more than a thousand metres into the lowland of Chryse Planitia. Two interconnected, old and heavily eroded impact craters are just visible in the plain (centre of image 1 and in perspective view, image 4). The larger one is approximately 75 kilometres across, while the smaller one is about 35 kilometres in diameter, - slightly larger than the 25-kilometre-wide Nordlinger Ries, an impact crater on Earth, located in Germany on the border between Wurttemberg and Bavaria.\n\nFurther north is a field with numerous mesas protruding from an otherwise flat plain: the larger mesas are up to three kilometres across and interpreted as remnants of a former, now eroded highland plain. Finally, in the upper right corner of the images, part of a 'fluidised' ejecta blanket can be seen. This is the result of an impact into a surface that contained subsurface water or ice. According to the prevailing model of Martian history, the ground ice was melted by the high impact energy. During such an impact, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of a mixture of water, rock and debris reach the surface and form these lobate ejecta blankets around the crater. These are characteristic of Mars and resemble mobilised mud.\n\nImage processing\n\nThe images were created using data acquired by the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on 18 February 2023 during Mars Express orbit 24,164. The ground resolution is approximately 18 metres per pixel. The images are centred at 339 degrees east and 25 degrees north. The colour image was created using data from the nadir channel, the field of view of which oriented perpendicular to the surface of Mars, and the colour channels.\n\nThe oblique perspective views were created using a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and data from the nadir channel and the colour channels. The anaglyph image, which gives a three-dimensional impression of the landscape when viewed with red/blue or red/green glasses, was derived using data from the nadir channel and one of the stereo channels. The colour-coded topographic view is based on a DTM of the region, from which the topography of the landscape can be derived. The reference body for the HRSC-DTM is a Martian equipotential surface (areoid).\n\nHRSC is a camera experiment developed and operated by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The systematic evaluation of the camera data was carried out at the DLR Institute of Planetary Research in Berlin-Adlershof. Personnel in the Department of Planetary Sciences and Remote Sensing at the Freie Universitat Berlin used these data to create the image products shown here.",

        "body": "To do that, the team is hoping to assess the target rocks, any evidence for the impactor, and the morphology of the craters. While the craters are very easy to see in orbital images, the view from the ground is a bit harder to assess, as seen in the above Navcam image.\n\nThe image shows some broken up blocks of bedrock in the foreground, and small depressions and ridges in the distance. Through a detailed imaging campaign and contact science, the team hopes to gain more insight into the origin of these features, before getting back on the road to continue climbing up Mount Sharp.\n\nToday's 3-sol plan focused on the crater cluster science with plenty of imaging and contact science. On the first sol, Curiosity will investigate the bedrock target \"La Trinite\" with DRT, MAHLI, and APXS, and a second target \"Rio Javari\" with MAHLI and APXS to better understand the target rock properties.\n\nThe team also planned two large Mastcam stereo mosaics to investigate the depth-to-diameter ratios and erosional state of several craters, and three ChemCam LIBS targets to assess variations in texture and chemistry of the local bedrock. Mastcam will also collect a multispectral observation of the DRT target, along with imaging to assess the movement of fines on the rover deck, and a small mosaic to investigate nearby troughs in the regolith.\n\nOn the second sol the rover will acquire a long distance ChemCam RMI mosaic looking back towards Peace Vallis - it's amazing to see how far we've come! The plan also includes environmental monitoring activities to look for clouds and dust devils and monitor dust in the atmosphere. Curiosity will drive on the third sol, which will hopefully bring us closer to one of the larger craters in this cluster for even more crater science next week!",

        "title": "Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5, Galaxy Watch 6 & Galaxy Tab S9 - all you need to know",
        "body": "Samsung took the wraps off its newest kit at its latest Galaxy Unpacked event. It was the first time the company hosted a launch event in its home city of Seoul in South Korea.\n\nThere are two new smartphones, the foldable Galaxy Z Fold 5 and the clamshell flip phone Galaxy Z Flip 5, along with three new tablets and two new smartwatches.\n\nAll the products arrive in stores on August 11.\n\nHere's everything you need to know...\n\nREAD MORE: 'Best flip phone' contender Razr 40 Ultra launched as Motorola takes aim at Samsung crown\n\nGalaxy Z Flip 4\n\nUnlike the other devices below, I've actually had a chance to briefly test this one out. The design of the Z Flip 5 has changed very little, but the big difference is it folds flat, so there's no gap. This is significant because it means dust and lint don't get into the gap. As a result, the phone is slimmer too. Z Flip 5 is 15.1 mm thick compared to the 17.1mm of its predecessor.\n\nThe cover display is the main change on Z Flip 5 and follows the example set by Motorola on its recently launched Razr 40 Ultra clamshell phone.\n\nSamsung's new 3.4in Super AMOLED panel has a 60Hz refresh rate and a resolution of 720 x 748 and 306 PPI. The cover display in theory means you have to open the phone out less. It provides access to 13 native widgets. A shortcut can be set to the camera app, or give you quick access to currently running activities. You can also reply to messages with a full QWERTY keyboard. And you can see basic information at a glance, such as time, weather, battery and notifications.\n\nI would say the new display looks nicer but I'm not sure it is a game-changer in everyday use. A full review later will hopefully answer that question.\n\nAs you would expect for a phone this expensive, Z Flip 5 is powered by the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 2 SoC (system on a chip). It comes with a sufficient but not earth-shattering 8GB of RAM and either 256GB or 512GB of storage.\n\nThe Z Flip 5 only supports 25W wired charging and the firm said it will charge from zero to 50 percent in roughly 30 minutes. I've tested some Android phones which can go from zero to 100 percent in less than 20 minutes.\n\nTo me the camera hardware seems unchanged from Z Flip 4: 12MP wide and ultrawide on the rear along with a 10MP front camera. The latter has a slightly better aperture. However, the software has improved and it's fair to say that even though the camera system is not flagship standard, many users will find the quality if images and video acceptable.\n\nThe main display is a 6.7in FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X Infinity Flex panel with a resolution of 2640 x 1080 and a wide 22:9 aspect ratio. The LTPO tech means the refresh rate can switch between 1Hz and 120Hz. The difference is peak brightness is now higher, at 1600 nits.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip5 goes on sale August 11 and comes in Graphite, Cream, Lavender and Mint colours and the price starts at \u20ac1,239 for 256GB/8GB, which is an \u20ac80 price bump over a similarly specced Z Flip 4.\n\nGalaxy Z Fold 5\n\nThe next-generation foldable phone lands with a brighter screen, faster chip and a thinner design.\n\nSamsung has managed to lose 10g of weight and slim the phone down by 2.4mm compared to last year's Galaxy Z Fold 4, which it says was possible due to an improved hinge mechanism.\n\nZ Fold 5's primary screen is the same as last year, a 7.6in almost square display with a peak brightness of 1,750 nits and 120h refresh rate display.\n\nYou can read my review of the Galaxy Z Fold 4 here and the reasons I loved it all still apply to the Z Fold 5.\n\nIt's powered by the currently highest-end Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, and has 12GB RAM, which for a phone this expensive frustratingly falls short of the 16GB RAM that Asus includes on the ROG Phone 7 Utra. It also supports wireless charging and is rated IPX8 for water-resistance. The X, incidentally, means it isn't dust-resistant.\n\nPrices are \u20ac1,999 for 256GB, \u20ac2,109 for 512GB and \u20ac2,349 for 1TB.\n\nGalaxy Tab S9\n\nThere are three new Samsung tablets.\n\nThe Galaxy Tab S9 line-up is only slightly different from last year's Tab S8 models, but there are now OLED screens in all three models.\n\nThey all have screens that can refresh up to 120Hz for smooth scrolling and lower pen latency.\n\nThe sizes remain the same: 11in on Galaxy Tab S9, 12.4in on Galaxy Tab S9 Plus and an incredible 14.6in for the Tab S9 Ultra.\n\nThe 16:10 aspect ratios unfortunately means these tablets will work best in landscape mode and will be less useful for reading and other portrait-orientation uses than the likes of iPad and OnePlus Pad.\n\nSamsung has added water and dust resistance to the tablets for the first time.\n\nPrices are high for tablets, and thus will probably only suit those looking for a productivity device.\n\nGalaxy Tab S9 starts at \u20ac949 for a WiFi only 128GB model. Tab S9 Plus costs from \u20ac1,049 for a 256GB WiFi only model and Tab S9 Ultra costs from \u20ac1,399 all the way up to \u20ac1,949 for the top spec 1TB WiFi and Cellular model.\n\nGalaxy Watch 6 Series\n\nSamsung went back to the drawing board with the Galaxy Watch 6 and returned with a fan-favourite: the physical rotating bezel which was missing on the Watch 5 series.\n\nThis year there are two models, neither of which is called Pro.\n\nThere's the standard aluminium Galaxy Watch 6 and the stainless steel, bezel-bearing, Galaxy Watch 6 Classic.\n\nBoth share the same sensors as last year's Galaxy Watch 5, but have a bigger battery and larger screens.\n\nSamsung has slimmed the bezels to squeeze larger screens into both of these watches. Galaxy Watch 6 comes with either 40mm or 44mm screens, while the Watch 6 Classic is between 43mm and 47mm.\n\nFor the Galaxy Watch 6, Samsung has managed to shave 30 percent from the bezel compared to its predecessor, while the Watch 6 Classic enjoys a more modest 15 percent reduction because of the way spinning bezels are used to quickly scroll through menus.\n\nThe firm has increased the peak brightness on the new series - topping out at an impressive 2,000 nits (matching the Apple Watch Ultra and roughly twice what you'll see on Apple Watch Series 8), which should mean the screen stays visible outdoors even in the odd burst of direct sunlight that we see in Ireland.\n\nSamsung has increased the size of the battery inside the Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic to support the bigger, brighter, displays.\n\nOther new features include Irregular heart rate notifications, a new track run workout type and the option to create custom workouts.\n\nSmartThings Find locates your phone from the watch even when it's not connected, using GPS to determine its last location.\n\nI'm happy to learn that moving to a new phone no longer requires you to reset the watch and start from scratch. This is a frustration with a lot of smartwatches, so hopefully others follow Samsung's lead.\n\nThere are new watch bands too, including a redesigned Milanese loop and a hybrid eco band made from industrial corn.\n\nGalaxy Watch Series 6 goes on sale August 11. Galaxy Watch 6 will cost from \u20ac329 and Galaxy watch 6 Classic will cost from \u20ac429.\n\nSign up for our weekly Tech and gaming newsletter",

All the ingredients are there.\"\n\nAustralia's most recent destructive bushfire season was the Black Summer of 2019-20, which scorched more than 24 million hectares and directly killed 33 people.\n\nMr Musulin said while he expected significantly high summer temperatures, it was too early to say whether Australia would bake under extreme heatwaves similar to those that have gripped the northern hemisphere in places such as southern Europe and the United States.\n\nHe also warned the index showed signs that Australia's underlying climate had changed, indicating a longer-term trend of an increasing frequency of extreme weather.\n\n\"What the climate index is showing us is consistent with the warming climate,\" Mr Musulin said.",

        "body": "It has been a miserable few days and this July could even be the wettest on record - but all hope is not lost as a high pressure could return to our shores as soon as next week\n\nAn Irish weather expert has indicated when better conditions will return after a miserable few weeks of rainfall.\n\nThis July could the wettest on record as low pressure continues to dominate.\n\nThere has been what has felt like non-stop rain and barely any nice weather apart from a few weeks in June this summer.\n\nHowever, one weather expert has given a date for when better conditions could return - and it's very soon.\n\nWhile today is a washout, summer weather could come back to Ireland as soon as next Friday, August 4th.\n\nAlan O'Reilly, who runs the popular Carlow Weather Twitter account, posted snaps of sunny weather on Tuesday evening and wrote: \"A mighty evening and a reminder of what summer can be. Hopefully August has some more in store.\n\n\"The models are really struggling to agree beyond the weekend but still a chance of high pressure from the around the 4th.\"\n\nAccording to Met Eireann's long-term forecast for August, we could see a rise in temperatures and less rainfall than the washouts we've experienced in July.\n\nFor the week of July 31 to August 6, high pressure - which results in more settled weather conditions - is expected to become more dominant, meaning we can still hold out hope for some proper summer weather.\n\nA Met Eireann forecaster said: \"This week is expected to remain changeable with low pressure at the surface and also aloft dominating. It is expected to average out a little wetter than average but with probably lower rainfall totals than occurred in in the previous week.\n\n\"This is due to high pressure to the southwest of Ireland exerting an influence over the country too, and some largely dry periods can be expected at times. The potential for the heaviest showers looks to be over Ulster. Temperatures will be around average for the beginning of August. It may be breezy at times especially over Ulster coasts.\"\n\nGet the latest RSVP headlines straight to your inbox for free by signing up to our newsletter\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community!

        "body": "The captain and two other crew members of a Palau-flagged container ship that sunk off the coast of southern Taiwan last week have been barred from leaving the island. The travel ban was announced on Thursday in a Facebook post from the Ocean Affairs Council Minister Kuan Bi-ling (\u7ba1\u78a7\u73b2).\n\nThe container ship, known as the Angel, sank while anchored near the port of Kaohsiung for unknown reasons on July 20, and all 19 crew members were able to abandon the ship. The Taiwan International Ports Corporation (TIPC) stated that oil-stop lines and oil-absorbing cotton ropes were deployed to contain and prevent oil pollution. As of Thursday, 233 of the Angel's 1,349 empty containers have been hauled ashore, while 977 sank with the ship, according to TIPC.\n\nKuan says that in the event of a ship accident, Taiwanese law stipulates that shipowners must immediately take measures to prevent, eliminate, or reduce any marine pollution. She says the captain of the Angel did not take preventative actions, and that the burden of the cleanup was borne by the Taiwanese government. Kuan says that the costs of cleanup as well as losses to fishermen caused by the pollution are to be borne by the polluter. She adds that the shipowner should come forward and deal with the situation as soon as possible.",

The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) has found traces of explosives in the hold of a dry cargo vessel sailing via a Ukrainian port and the Kerch Strait to Rostov-on-Don to pick up a load of grain, the FSB told TASS on Thursday.\n\n\"On July 26, traces of explosives - dinitrotoluene and trotyl - were found in the hold of and on board a life boat of a foreign dry cargo vessel, BMO River, on its way from the port of Sinop, Turkey via the Kerch Strait to Rostov-on-Don to pick up a grain cargo. It was established that the vessel called at the Ukrainian seaport of Reni in the Odessa Region twice this June and July,\" the FSB reported.\n\nIt was decided to bar the vessel from passing under the arch of the Kerch Strait crossing and prohibit its further departure for waters beyond the territorial sea of the Russian Federation, the FSB added.\n\nOn Saturday, traces of explosives were found in the hold of another foreign cargo ship sailing from Turkey to Rostov-on-Don to pick up a grain cargo. According to the FSB, in late May the ship was docked in Ukraine's Danube River port of Kiliya. In July, it was located in the Turkish port of Tuzla, where the ship's crew was replaced entirely by a new crew, consisting of 12 Ukrainian citizens, and the vessel was renamed. The FSB said then that the abovementioned circumstances indicated that a foreign civilian ship might possibly have been used to deliver explosives to the territory of Ukraine. Back then, the vessel was also barred from passing via the Kerch Strait.",

        "title": "Commentary: How we got endless summer breaks from school - and what we can do about it ",
        "body": "With a Press Herald subscription, you can gift 5 articles each month.\n\nOur long summer vacation is a relic from an agricultural past when kids were needed for seasonal work on farms - or so we've been told. Since that's no longer the case, we should lay the three-month summer break to rest, right?\n\nA teacher instructs students in a physical science class during summer school at Canoga Park High School in Los Angeles in 2022. Mel Melcon/Los Angeles Times/TNS\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nJonathan Zimmerman teaches education and history at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of \"Whose America? Culture Wars in the Public Schools.\"\n\nWe've heard that argument over and over again from politicians and other critics of summer vacation and all its parental and educational discontents. The COVID-19 pandemic, which spawned dramatic learning losses for America's students, only heightened concerns about long summer breaks. Our kids need more school, the reasoning goes, and summer is an obvious time to start.\n\nThey might be right about that, but the oft-repeated folk history is wrong. When our common school system began, in the early 19th century, students actually went to school in the summer. And if we want to bring them back today, we'll need new ways to teach them.\n\nWhen most Americans lived and worked on farms, the busy seasons were spring and fall - for planting and harvesting, respectively. So kids attended school in the winter and, yes, in the summer, as historian Kenneth Gold has explained.\n\nThat changed after the Civil War, during America's great industrial boom. As more families moved into cities, educators worried that summer school terms would make children susceptible to smallpox, diphtheria and the other epidemic diseases that flared in the hotter months.\n\nEducators also argued that keeping children inside during the summer would prevent them from enjoying the bounties of free outdoor play. \"Let Mary run and be as hedonist as she pleases; let Tommy roll in the mud,\" a Massachusetts observer wrote. \"They will be all the better for it, more hardy, blooming, and vigorous when vacation is over.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was just one problem: America's cities were filthy. Despite the romantic nods to nature and health, children who lived in urban areas were more likely to encounter grime and disease and, if left unsupervised, get into other kinds of trouble as well.\n\n\"Scores of the children will be seen sitting listlessly on the steps of the tenements or playing half-hearted games on the streets,\" a New Yorker worried of city summers in 1903. \"Many will be seen pitching pennies, or at games of cards, or playing craps. ... The sight of boys stealing fruit is not infrequent.\"\n\nEnter the \"vacation school,\" which early 20th-century reformers touted as an antidote to the boredom and danger of the streets. Prefiguring today's summer school advocates, who note that poor kids in particular lose academic skills during the summer, one advocate contended that vacation schools would \"prevent the demoralizing effect of the long weeks of idleness.\"\n\nBut they shouldn't simply repeat what kids did during the academic year, she added. To the contrary, vacation schools would also relieve the torpor and boredom of \"regular\" school. \"Pupils were allowed the freedom of the halls; they played bean bag ... danced, sang, and marched,\" a Denver superintendent wrote in praising his city's vacation schools in 1902.\n\nAs the 20th century continued, however, vacation schools lost their alternative edge. They evolved into summer school, which provided remedial instruction for kids who fell behind. And they also provided academic credit, subjecting them to all of the bureaucratic rules of regular school.\n\nThat gave summer school a negative taint that it has never lost. If we continue to treat summer school as an extension of regular school, we'll reinforce the stigma attached to summer school and the kids who attend it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Why should they have to sit in a building and do math all day while their higher-income peers are off in some fancy camp?\" asked Rand Corp. researcher Catherine Augustine, who studies summer education.\n\nIt's a good question, and there's only one answer: Summer school has to provide the kind of enrichment activities that well-to-do kids already receive in privately run summer camps and schools. Taking a page from the vacation school example, we should imagine it as a respite from the academic year rather than simply a recapitulation or extension of it.\n\nSome of that is already happening. In Orange County, Florida, summer schools are providing music and art enrichment alongside academic instruction; in Texas, they teach canoeing and swimming.\n\nMuch of this activity is funded by federal COVID aid to schools, 20% of which must be used to combat learning loss. That shouldn't be the only goal, however. Indeed, the most successful summer schools will be the ones that look the least like regular school.\n\nWe would also need to bring teachers aboard, which might be the biggest challenge of all. Exhausted and demoralized in the wake of the pandemic, many teachers have been cool to the idea of summer school.\n\nBut maybe, just maybe, a new take on summer schooling could connect more teachers with the passion and idealism that brought them into education in the first place. Our kids went to school in the summer when the nation was young. With the right approach - and the right people to teach them - they can do so again.\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Earlier to 1970 there was a good trial to promote Dogri language through a Dogri Film \"Gallan Hoian Beettian\" screened by the local director / producer and local artists. It gained the popularity for some time but no solid results could be achieved. Awareness was put through also by the renowned Dogri poets.It is felt that unless this language is recocognised as a subject during schooling, chances are very less to achieve the target. It's my personal view.\n\nSK Sharma\n\nJammu\n\nII\n\nIt is a substantive piece Sharma ji which gives adequate prescriptions to the policy makers, educationists, literatteurs alike for the advancement and profitable use of languages particularly our Maa Boli Dogri. I have tried to make my humble contribution to dogri literature by publishing two Anthologies of dogri poems in which I have tried to explore and try new idiom, themes and varied imagery. Some of these poems definitely meet the criteria you have underlined in your article and these can be certainly taught in the educational institutions.\n\nAshok Angurana\n\nIII\n\nA well researched write-up. It not only highlights importance of Dogri language; at the same time it's incorporation in official working of the UT, in particular in Revenue, Police and Judiciary, as suggested in the write-up up, if implimented, would be a landmark step in the right direction.\n\nVarinder Gupta,\n\nTrikuta Nagar Jammu",

        "title": "Ratings firms struggle with climate risk in $133 trillion market",
        "body": "With 46 straight days of 100-degree heat and coastal waters approaching hot-tub temperatures, Miami can seem like a clear example of the costs of a warming world. But analysts at S&P Global Inc. aren't sweating it.\n\nThey recently upgraded Miami's credit rating, citing a robust tax base and labor market. The city's \"elevated\" environmental risks, S&P says, are offset by mitigation projects such as those designed to counter rising sea levels.\n\nAs the world reels from the mounting impact of heat waves, droughts and fiercer storms, there is growing concern that credit rating analysts are misreading climate risks in the $133 trillion global bond market, to the detriment of creditors and borrowers alike.\n\nResearch by the European Central Bank shows that even when climate variables are statistically significant, they play only a marginal role in influencing sovereign ratings. And a study conducted by a Federal Reserve economist indicates that extreme weather events may end up restricting some governments' ability to issue debt.\n\nClimate change has \"yet to be hardwired into the methodology\" used by the biggest ratings companies, said Moritz Kraemer, who oversaw S&P Global's sovereign debt ratings until 2018 and is now head of research at Germany's LBBW Bank.\n\nIt's only 15 years since S&P, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings famously misjudged the subprime mortgage market that triggered the 2008 financial meltdown. Now, they're under fire for potentially underestimating potential climate losses in a rating system more tuned to the near term.\n\nS&P, Moody's and Fitch say they do account for climate risks, though it isn't an easy calculation. Since the start of 2022, S&P has published five climate-related ratings actions on non-financial companies. It says climate regulations have yet to bite and most companies' net zero spending isn't big enough to affect financials or ratings.\n\nS&P Global said it evaluates the impact of ESG credit factors for its debt ratings. These factors include climate transition and physical risks, health and safety, and risk management. They can impact a rating if they're deemed to be material to creditworthiness and if S&P can measure their impact with enough certainty, according to a company spokesperson.\n\nAt Fitch, climate change and other environmental risks have affected about 6% of its ratings, though it expects that to change within the decade. Some 20% of global corporations may face ratings downgrades by 2035 due to climate vulnerabilities, according to Fitch estimates.\n\nMoody's estimates that sectors facing high or very high environmental credit risk now account for $4.3 trillion in rated debt, a figure that's doubled since late 2015. But when the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a nonprofit in Lakewood, Ohio, looked at Moody's ESG credit scores for 721 companies in high-emitting industries, it found that about 60% of issuers with high credit ratings were highly exposed to environmental risks, including climate change.\n\n\"A weaker ESG credit score should conceptually result in a weaker credit rating, yet this isn't always the case,\" said Hazel Ilango, an analyst at IEEFA.\n\nA Moody's spokesman said the company \"systematically, consistently and transparently\" incorporates credit-relevant ESG factors, including climate risks, into its ratings.\n\nCredit rating companies need to move more swiftly, said Matthew Agarwala, an economist at Cambridge University. \"They're inching forward, but the icecaps are melting faster,\" he said.\n\nAgarwala, his Cambridge colleague Kamiar Mohaddes and Patrycja Klusak of the University of East Anglia have studied the impact of climate change on economic growth and sovereign debt markets. In a paper due to be published in the journal Management Science, they and other academics map out some of the loss scenarios.\n\nFor example, if climate risks were properly calculated under a conservative, low-emissions trajectory, 58 sovereigns would experience \"downward pressure\" on ratings by 2030. Chile and India would be among the worst hit. The affected countries' annual interest payments would rise by as much as $67 billion under the moderate scenario, and up to $203 billion under a more extreme scenario.\n\nMarc Painter, assistant professor of finance at Saint Louis University in Missouri, studied almost 20,000 long-term bond issuances. He found that a U.S. county facing a 1% increase in climate risk pays an average $1.7 million more annually in underwriting fees and initial yields, compared with counties unlikely to be affected by climate change. That additional $1.7 million \"implies a county with higher sea level rise risk will spend 5% more to issue their bonds,\" Painter said.\n\nCentral bank researchers, meanwhile, worry that a climate shock could tip a vulnerable sovereign issuer into default.\n\nEnrico Mallucci, an economist at the Fed, examined the impact of hurricanes on seven Caribbean countries. Under a scenario forecast in climate-change literature -- namely that the frequency of high-category hurricanes goes up 29% and their intensity increases 49% -- debt spreads will increase more than 30%, he said.\n\n\"Extreme weather restricts governments' ability to issue debt,\" Mallucci said. And \"extreme weather events and natural disasters are poised to become even more sizable in the coming years.\"\n\nAs for the $3.8 trillion U.S. municipal debt market, Tom Doe, president of the research firm Municipal Market Analytics Inc., said that as far as he knows, \"no U.S. municipal issuer's credit rating has been changed because of climate change risk.\"\n\nIn a report published last September, the ECB found that most ratings firms have made progress, but they still do a poor job of explaining their climate calculations, including transition and physical risk. \"The magnitude of the impact of material climate change risk on credit ratings is rarely disclosed,\" the ECB said.\n\nAngela Maddaloni, a researcher at the ECB who wasn't involved in the September report, said credit ratings currently don't offer \"good measures of certain climate risks.\"\n\nBlackRock Inc., Schroders Plc and other investment managers aren't waiting for the ratings industry to catch up. They're already designing products or selecting bonds based on climate risks that aren't always captured in credit scores.\n\nSaida Eggerstedt, head of sustainable credit at Schroders, recently declined to buy a green bond issued by Alliander NV, a Dutch electricity distributor. Moody's rated the issue Aa3, but Eggerstedt was turned off in part because the firm lacks public climate targets and has a relatively high carbon intensity. \"You can get frustrated when long-term, non-financial impacts aren't reflected in credit ratings,\" she said.\n\nIn 2020, BlackRock introduced a first-of-its-kind exchange-traded fund that weights debt issued by euro-zone sovereigns on the basis of exposure to climate risk. Belgium and the Netherlands are among countries with the lowest weightings due to their higher perceived climate exposure. It's one of a number of similar ETFs that BlackRock is developing.\n\nSuch products \"meet the growing interest from clients to mitigate risk and capture opportunities associated with climate and the transition to a low-carbon economy,\" said Manuela Sperandeo, global head of sustainable indexing at BlackRock.\n\nS&P, Moody's and Fitch all acknowledge that climate change is likely to have a material impact on debt markets. The question is when -- and whether the ratings will capture it before it's too late.\n\nAlex Griffiths, head of EMEA corporate ratings at Fitch, said that \"if you go out even 15 years, we know very significant things are likely to be happening.\"",

        "body": "QUINCY TWP. -- The Quincy township board voted Tuesday night to request attorney Chuck Lillis draft a ballot millage for the November election to raise $500,000 to purchase a building for a township hall.\n\nClerk Marc Brand said the current joint use of the Quincy village hall would not work for future elections, with new requirements for nine days of voting set to begin for elections next year under Proposal 2.\n\n\"We don't have our own place to hold elections. We have to impose on the village and they have to shut down for the day. This will give us our own space to hold elections with plenty of room for everybody,\" the township clerk said.\n\nThe current township office and hall is tucked into the basement of the Quincy Library.\n\nThe township moved its elections to the village after state officials deemed the small room in the library basement used for meetings was inadequate for voting.\n\nOver the last decade, the township renovated the historic library to preserve the structure.\n\nPrior story Quincy library restoration fund nears goal\n\nThe township did little to its basement room. \"It doesn't serve as a very good township hall. We need a permanent space for the clerk and the treasurer and just the board in general,\" Brand explained.\n\nThe township has started talks with Jeff and Ronda Falknor, owners of the Country Wedding Chapel and Event Center at 295 N. Ray/Quincy Road.\n\nThe township will negotiate an option for purchase contingent upon the passage of the millage, the board decided.\n\nWith an Aug. 15 deadline to place a millage on the ballot, the board selected an amount considered necessary to find and renovate a township hall.\n\nThe board asked Lillis to draft the proposal to raise that $500,000.\n\nBrand noted other townships have adequate facilities, \"It'd be nice to have something for people to use in the community.\"\n\nSubscribe Follow the millage for the Quincy Township hall. Subscribe to the Daily Reporter.\n\nTrustee Jim Harmon said a HAVC inspection showed one of three furnaces in the proposed building is in good shape. The other two and the air conditioning need replacing, estimated at $30,000.\n\nThe rest of the 4,200-square-foot building seems to be in good condition, but the township will get an inspection for the entire structure.\n\nBrand said he discussed the purchase idea around the township and found support.\n\n---Contact Don Reid: dReid@Gannett.com.",

Family 'in a place where we can't move on'\n\nIt's an Amazon world and we're all just living in it - except when it comes to grocery stores.\n\nEven Amazon admits that its grocery stores and online platforms aren't getting the results the company expects. That's why the technology titan is rolling out a huge grocery initiative billed as its largest grocery business overhaul since it bought Whole Foods in 2017.\n\nDON'T MISS: Amazon Stock Has Done Well\n\nOver the next several months, Amazon intends to remodel its physical stores, consolidate digital shopping carts, and bring non-Prime members aboard for foodstuff deliveries.\n\nThe move signals a significant shift toward a higher-profile presence for Amazon in the highly-competitive grocery industry, which is valued at about $1.5 trillion in 2023.\n\n\"We're serious about grocery,\" said Amazon senior vice president of worldwide physical stores Tony Hoggett, in comments to Bloomberg which first reported the story. \"Our plan is on building this really strong grocery relationship with customers over time.\"\n\nMore Retail:\n\n'Too Pretty' Home Depot Worker Faces Backlash After Viral Mirror PostA Classic Kitchenware Brand Files for Chapter 11 BankruptcyWho's Running The Gap? With no CEO, Retailer Hurtles Towards Crisis\n\nHere are three moves Amazon is planning on making in its grocery services restructuring:\n\nNon-Prime members can order online from Amazon Fresh. Previously, only Amazon Prime members, who pay a yearly fee of $139, could order from Amazon Fresh. Now Amazon is making Fresh deliveries available to anyone. The company is testing 12 cities for a Fresh delivery rollout for the masses, although non-Prime members are expected to pay $4 more delivery fees than Prime members pay.\n\nConsolidating online shopping carts. In the past, consumers often had to buy food products from three Amazon web pages - Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh, and Amazon.com - depending on the product purchased. Now Amazon says it's \"unifying\" its grocery shopping cart experience into a single cart for groceries, which should roll out in late 2023 or in 2024.\n\nBrightening up its physical stores. To better compete with Walmart and Kroger, Amazon aims to spruce up its 40 Fresh stores in the U.S., which were first opened in 2020. The company is adding 1,500 items to its Fresh lineup, and adding amenities like a Krispy Kreme stand at the front of the stores to greet customers.\n\nThe Amazon Fresh stores have come under some criticism from shoppers for being too bland and sterile and Amazon aims to fix that. The company is also expected to add hundreds of Fresh stores in the next few years, as Amazon has been busy snapping up real estate across the U.S. to accommodate more physical grocery stores.\n\nAmazon plans to install self-checkout lanes for customers but will keep its popular Just Walk Out non-contact payment system for its Fresh stores.\n\nGet exclusive access to portfolio managers and their proven investing strategies with Real Money Pro.

        "title": "Why Rivian Stock Sank Today | The Motley Fool",
        "body": "The competition might be signaling problems ahead for Rivian.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN -5.08%) shares have more than doubled in the last three months, but that run might be coming to an end. After recovering from an early drop in yesterday's trading, Rivian stock is heading lower again Wednesday morning. As of 10:25 a.m. ET, Rivian shares were down by 5.3%\n\nNews from the competition looks to be what's driving the stock lower today. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) released its July sales data today, and electric vehicle (EV) sales dropped by 18% compared to last year. That's especially notable since the automaker has been working hard to ramp up production this year. Ford also sold nearly twice as many hybrid vehicles as EVs last month. Its hybrid sales jumped more than 31% year over year.\n\nSince Ford is currently Rivian's biggest electric pickup truck competitor with its F-150 Lightning, that report might signal a demand issue for Rivian. That wasn't evident when Rivian reported its second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries one month ago, but investors will want to hear what the company has to say when it provides its full second-quarter update on Aug. 8.\n\nUntil that report is announced, investors are going on what information they have. And whether demand is waning for electric pickup trucks or not, more competition is definitely coming for Rivian.\n\nEven with Ford's drop in EV sales, it said yesterday that it has completed retooling work at the plant that produces the F-150 Lightning and has restarted production. The company said the facility will have triple the production capacity by this fall.\n\nAnd it's not just Ford that Rivian investors will need to watch. General Motors will be entering the market next year with the electric version of its Silverado pickup truck. Ford's sales slump and the growing competition have investors taking some profits after Rivian's recent stock surge. But the next catalyst should come next week when Rivian reports its quarterly update.",

        "body": "While Modelo Especial has been able to overtake Bud Light as the most popular beer in the U.S., it may not be the biggest beneficiary of the brand's downfall.\n\nIt's doubtful people who love American lagers like Bud Light would jump ship to a Mexican brand like Modelo, a more natural pivot would be to another domestic beer.\n\nDON'T MISS: Heineken CEO Has Some Harsh Criticism For Bud Light's Actions\n\nIt looks like that beneficiary is Molson Coors (TAP) - Get Free Report and its Coors Light and Miller Lite brands.\n\nMolson saw an 11.8% year over year increase in net sales and a 5% increase in financial volumes in the second quarter. CEO Gavin Hattersley said: \"we are seeing share and market improvement everywhere, and more consumers are reaching for our beers than our competitors' beers.\"\n\nThe fallout from Bud Light's (BUD) - Get Free Report decision to bring on transgender social media influencer Dylan Mulvaney as a spokesperson -- and the subsequent boycott that resulted -- means that Coors Light and Miller Lite are now 50% bigger than Bud Light by total industry dollars, according to Hattersley.\n\n\"Last year, Bud Light was bigger than both. Retailers are making space for our brands as demand increases,\" Hattersley said.\n\nDespite the gains brought about by Bud Light's downfall, the overall beer market is still shrinking in the U.S. in 2023, with softness on the West Coast, particularly California, where the company says \"really difficult weather conditions in the first part of the year\" challenged the overall industry.\n\n\"However, core beer drinkers are incredibly loyal and have maintained their share of dollars and volume in beer,\" Hattersley said.\n\nBut Bud Light has tested that loyalty, and it is anyone's guess as to whether it will ever be able to recover its formerly loyal fanbase.",

        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- The private equity owners of Stada Arzneimittel AG are weighing options for the German drugmaker, including a possible sale, people with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nBain Capital and Cinven are in the early stages of asking banks to pitch for roles on a possible transaction, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information. A sale could value Stada at \u20ac10 billion ($10.1 billion) or more, the people said.\n\nThe private equity firms are prepared to explore a range of options for Stada, including a sale that excludes its operations in Russia, one of the people said. They may also consider an initial public offering of the company, according to the people.\n\nDeliberations are ongoing and Bain and Cinven could still decide to hold onto the asset for longer, they said. Representatives for Bain, Cinven and Stada declined to comment.\n\nBain and Cinven agreed to buy Stada for \u20ac5.3 billion in 2017. The deal gave the private equity firms control of what was one of the last independent generic-drug businesses in Europe.\n\nStada was founded in the late 19th century. Based in Bad Vilbel near Frankfurt, the company today employs about 10,000 people and operates across more than 30 markets, including Germany and Russia. Stada saw earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization rise 17% to \u20ac875 million last year.\n\nTo be sure, a deal for a company of Stada's size could prove tricky to execute for private equity buyers amid the current challenges for financing large buyouts. Many big health-care companies, meanwhile, having been prioritizing deals for treatments of rare diseases over generic drugs. Novartis AG is preparing to spin off its generic-drug unit Sandoz later this year.\n\nThe value of deals targeting the health-care sector has risen 26% this year to $192 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Private equity firms have been taking advantage of strong demand for such assets. Advent International is seeking a value of as much as $2 billion for ICE Pharma, as it prepares a sale of the Italian health-care firm.",

And yet, we're just getting started as we work toward our 20th consecutive year of same store sales growth and our vision of becoming a Top 10 Global Restaurant Brand.\"\n\nKey operating metrics for the fiscal second quarter 2023 compared to the fiscal second quarter 2022:\n\nThirteen Weeks Ended\n\nJuly 1, 2023\n\nJune 25, 2022\n\nNumber of system-wide restaurants open at end of period\n\n2,046\n\n1,858\n\nNumber of domestic franchise restaurants open at end of period\n\n1,749\n\n1,600\n\nNumber of international franchise restaurants open at end of period\n\n252\n\n219\n\nSystem-wide sales (in millions)\n\n$ 810\n\n$ 634\n\nDomestic AUV (in thousands)\n\n$ 1,704\n\n$ 1,581\n\nDomestic same store sales growth\n\n16.8 %\n\n(3.3) %\n\nCompany-owned domestic same store sales growth\n\n5.7 %\n\n(4.9) %\n\nNet income (in thousands)\n\n$ 16,181\n\n$ 13,307\n\nAdjusted net income (in thousands)\n\n$ 17,005\n\n$ 13,345\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (in thousands)\n\n$ 34,350\n\n$ 23,344\n\nFiscal second quarter 2023 financial results\n\nTotal revenue for the fiscal second quarter 2023 increased to $107.2 million from $83.8 million in the fiscal second quarter last year. Royalty revenue, franchise fees and other increased $11.9 million primarily due to domestic same store sales growth of 16.8% and 182 net new franchise restaurants since June 25, 2022. Advertising fees increased $7.6 million due to a 27.8% increase in system-wide sales in the fiscal second quarter 2023.

As a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales, cost of sales decreased to 73.7% from 79.5% in the prior year comparable period. The decrease was primarily driven by food, beverage and packaging costs benefiting from a 39.6% decrease in the cost of bone-in chicken wings as compared to the prior fiscal second quarter.\n\nSelling, general & administrative (\"SG&A\") increased $8.2 million to $22.1 million from $13.9 million in the fiscal second quarter of the prior year.

The decrease was driven by $1.6 million in interest income earned on our cash balances during the thirteen weeks ended July 1, 2023.\n\nFinancial Outlook\n\nBased on year-to-date results, the Company is providing updated guidance for 2023, which is a 52-week fiscal year:\n\n10% to 12% domestic same store sales growth, previously high-single digits; 240 to 250 global net new units, previously 240 global net new units;SG&A of between $91.0 - $93.0 million, which includes $3.9 million in consulting projects to support the Company's strategic initiatives, previously $85.5 - $87.5 million ; andStock-based compensation expense of approximately $14.0 - $15.0 million, reflecting an increase in incentive based compensation based on company performance, previously $12.0 - $13.0 million .\n\nAdditionally, the Company is reiterating guidance for depreciation and amortization of between $14.0 - $15.0 million for 2023.\n\nRestaurant Development\n\nAs of July 1, 2023, there were 2,046 Wingstop restaurants system-wide. This included 1,794 restaurants in the United States, of which 1,749 were franchised restaurants and 45 were company-owned, and 252 franchised restaurants were in international markets. During the fiscal second quarter 2023, there were 50 net system-wide Wingstop restaurant openings.\n\nQuarterly Dividend\n\nIn recognition of the Company's strong cash flow generation and our commitment to returning value to stockholders, on August 1, 2023, our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend payable to Wingstop stockholders from $0.19 to $0.22 per share of common stock, resulting in a total dividend of approximately $6.6 million . This dividend will be paid on September 8, 2023 to stockholders of record as of August 18, 2023 .\n\nThe following definitions apply to these terms as used in this release:\n\nDomestic average unit volume (\"AUV\") consists of the average annual sales of all restaurants that have been open for a trailing 52-week period or longer. This measure is calculated by dividing sales during the applicable period for all restaurants being measured by the number of restaurants being measured. Domestic AUV includes revenue from both company-owned and franchised restaurants. Domestic AUV allows management to assess our domestic company-owned and franchised restaurant economics. Changes in domestic AUV are primarily driven by increases in same store sales and are also influenced by opening new restaurants.\n\nDomestic same store sales reflects the change in year-over-year sales for the same store restaurant base. We define the same store restaurant base to include those restaurants open for at least 52 full weeks. This measure highlights the performance of existing restaurants, while excluding the impact of new restaurant openings and permanent closures. We review same store sales for domestic company-owned restaurants as well as system-wide domestic restaurants. Domestic same store sales growth is driven by increases in transactions and average transaction size. Transaction size increases are driven by price increases or favorable mix shift from either an increase in items purchased or shifts into higher priced items.\n\nSystem-wide sales represents net sales for all of our company-owned and franchised restaurants, as reported by franchisees. This measure allows management to better assess changes in our royalty revenue, our overall store performance, the health of our brand and the strength of our market position relative to competitors. Our system-wide sales growth is driven by new restaurant openings as well as increases in same store sales.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), further adjusted for losses on debt extinguishment and financing transactions, transaction costs, costs and fees associated with investments in our strategic initiatives, and stock-based compensation expense. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, gains and losses on disposal of assets are no longer presented as an adjustment to EBITDA, in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. Prior period amounts have been excluded from EBITDA adjustments to conform to the current presentation.\n\nAdjusted net income is defined as net income adjusted for losses on debt extinguishment and financing transactions, transaction costs, costs and fees associated with investments in our strategic initiatives, and related tax adjustments that management believes are not indicative of the Company's core operating results or business outlook over the long-term.\n\nAdjusted earnings per diluted share is defined as adjusted net income divided by weighted average diluted share count.\n\nWe caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions above may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors because not all companies and analysts calculate certain non-GAAP measurements in the same manner.\n\nConference Call and Webcast\n\nThe Company will host a conference call today to discuss the fiscal second quarter 2023 financial results at 10:00 AM Eastern Time . The conference call can be joined telephonically by dialing 1-877-259-5243 or 1-412-317-5176 (international) and asking for the Wingstop conference call.

        "title": "Ferrari stock reverses despite boosted guidance, higher 'personalizations' spending",
        "body": "Italian luxury automaker Ferrari reported second quarter results that beat expectations, but an improved outlook powered by bespoke \"personalizations\" wasn't enough to impress investors.\n\nFrom a guidance point of view, Ferrari (RACE) now sees full-year adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of as much as \u20ac2.19 -2.22 billion ($2.43 billion), up from prior guidance of \u20ac2.13-2.18 billion ($2.39 billion). Ferrari also bumped up its full-year revenue forecast slightly to \u20ac5.8 billion ($6.36 billion), up from a prior \u20ac5.7 billion.\n\nThe decision to revise the guidance upwards was supported in particular by stunning results in personalizations,\" Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna said in a statement. \"We see this trend that is better than expected,\" Vigna followed up on the earnings call this morning.\n\nNonetheless, Ferrari's guidance hike wasn't enough for investors, as US-listed shares were lower in midday trade. That being said, investors could be taking profits as Ferrari shares have surged an astounding 46% this year.\n\nOverall for the quarter, Ferrari reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA of \u20ac589 million ($645.4 million), topping analyst estimates of \u20ac577 million ($632.3 million), and up 31.9% from a year ago. Revenue for the quarter came in at \u20ac1.47 billion ($1.61 billion), up 14.1% from a year ago on sales of 3,392 vehicles, nearly identical to a year ago.\n\nIn terms of deliveries, Ferrari shipped 3,392 vehicles in Q2, a slight decrease of 63 cars from a year ago. The model mix contained nine gas-powered cars and four hybrid engine models, with hybrid deliveries hitting a 43.0% share, more than double a year ago, Ferrari said.\n\nThe Purosangue, which is Ferrari's first-ever four-door, four-seat vehicle, began deliveries in Q2 following a strong response after its launch late last year. Ferrari also unveiled the Roma Spider earlier this year, and is aiming to release four new vehicles in 2023.\n\nBernstein analyst Daniel Roeska wrote in a note to clients Wednesday morning that Ferrari could surprise with another guidance raise later this year, however, due to the Purosangue.\n\n\"Mix will improve since Purosangue and Daytona SP3 deliveries have only started gaining speed - this would only enhance the higher than expected option (personalization) uptake,\" Roeska wrote. \"Ferrari has also commented that it may have shifted some delivery timeframes from Q2 to Q3 to offset the drag from summer shutdowns, providing another source of dry powder.\"\n\nFerrari also reiterated that its first full electric vehicle is expected to debut in 2025, and EVs and hybrids are expected to be the vast majority of sales for the company in the back half of the decade.\n\nLastly, Ferrari adjusted costs from its Formula 1 (FWONK) racing team, with the company seeing lower costs due to \"revised Formula 1 in season ranking assumptions.\" With the team currently sitting fourth (191 points) overall for the 2023 season, analysts on the call were questioning whether the team could work its way back up to 2nd place, where the team finished last year, based how far it is behind Mercedes (247 points) which sits solidly in that position.\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "body": "Shares of the RV dealer pulled back after it missed estimates in its second-quarter earnings report.\n\nShares of Camping World (CWH -13.14%) were pulling back today as the country's largest RV dealer posted second-quarter results that were below analyst estimates as the business continues to normalize following the boom during the pandemic.\n\nAs of 10:01 a.m. ET, the stock was down 10.6%.\n\nCamping World said revenue in the quarter declined 12.4% to $1.9 billion, missing analyst expectations at $1.97 billion.\n\nThe slide in revenue came in spite of record unit sales as Camping World's sales mix continues to shift from new vehicle revenue to used vehicle revenue, where the company believes it has a competitive advantage.\n\nNew vehicle revenue in the quarter fell 25.7% to $800.9 million, and new vehicle unit sales declined by 19% to 18,897. Used vehicle revenue, meanwhile, increased 12.1% to $623 million, with used vehicle units sold up 14% to 17.774.\n\nFurther down the income statement, gross margin fell 301 basis points to 30% due to lower average selling prices of new vehicles, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) was down by 50% to $139.3 million.\n\nOn the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share dropped from $2.16 in the quarter a year ago to $0.73, which was short of the consensus at $0.78.\n\nCEO Marcus Lemonis said, \"We sold the most used units in our company's history, with record-setting used vehicle gross profit. We've opened, acquired, or signed letters of intent on 30 dealership locations year to date. The unprecedented influx of acquisition opportunities has continued and the pipeline is robust. We plan to capitalize on it as we invest ahead of anticipated revenue growth in 2024 and beyond.\"\n\nCamping World didn't provide guidance in the earnings release, but investors should be encouraged by Lemonis' comments about returning to revenue growth next year, a sign he thinks the cyclical headwinds are nearly finished.\n\nThe company, which has been growing through an acquisition strategy known as a roll-up, continues to add new dealerships, which should pave the way to further growth.\n\nCamping World is also a top dividend payer, with a dividend yield of 9% after today's sell-off. The company declared its third-quarter dividend yesterday, and the payout looks safe after yesterday's report.\n\nGiven the expected return to growth, long-term investors shouldn't be worried about today's sell-off.",

        "title": "Private sector added 324K jobs in July",
        "body": "Private sector employers added 324,000 jobs in July as annual pay grew 6.2% year over year, according to payroll processor ADP, which separately added generative artificial intelligence features to its software this week.\n\nADP reported Wednesday that most of the job gains occurred in small and medium-size businesses, while larger companies actually cut jobs. Small establishments added 237,000 jobs in July, including 114,000 in small businesses with between one and 19 employees and 123,000 in businesses with between 20 and 49 employees. Medium-size establishments with between 50 and 249 employees added 152,000 jobs, but businesses with between 250 and 499 employees lost 14,000 jobs, and large companies with 500 employees or more lost 67,000 employees.\n\nThe service-providing sector added 303,000 jobs, including 5,000 in professional and business services like accounting and tax preparation, and 201,000 in leisure and hospitality. However, the financial activities sector, which includes banking, lost 5,000 jobs for the month. The goods-producing sector gained 21,000 jobs in July, including 48,000 in natural resources and mining and 9,000 in construction, offset by a loss of 36,000 jobs in manufacturing.\n\n\"We're not seeing the same labor market strength that we saw in earlier parts of the recovery,\" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, during a conference call Wednesday with reporters. \"This is not a broad-based hiring. What we're seeing is strengthened pockets. We're even seeing something different in the composition of hires this month versus last month. Last month, we had another big number, bigger than the one this month, revised to 455,000 jobs created. But what stood out to us last month was the dominance of consumer-facing industries. They really carried the water of all that hiring we saw for June, which is traditionally a strong hiring month. Now we're seeing a bit lower hiring.\"\n\nJob stayers experienced a year-over-year pay increase of 6.2%, but that was the slowest pace of gains since November 2021. For job changers, pay growth slowed to 10.2%. In the professional and business services sector, the median change in annual pay for job stayers was 6.0%.\n\nADP has seen pay growth decline from a high of 16% in the spring of 2022, and pay growth is decreasing for new hires as well. \"What we're seeing is that their pay growth compared to cohorts in previous years is declining,\" said Richardson. \"In some industries like information, it's outright declines in pay, but for all sectors, it's very tepid growth from last year. Across the board, when we look at pay, we're seeing a slower growth rate now than before.\"\n\nHowever, she cautioned that the 6.2% rate of pay growth is still approximately double what ADP prior to the pandemic. \"That number used to be around 3%,\" said Richardson. \"Yes, it's progress in terms of growth when you're looking at it from the lens of inflation, but it's not nearly as slow growth as we were seeing as was normal and customary before the pandemic. For the Fed, there's a lot of messages here: a solid labor market, though highly fragmented, and pay growth that is coming down, but not back to historical [levels].\"\n\nGenerative AI payroll\n\nSeparately, ADP said Tuesday that its mobile app, Roll by ADP, now uses generative AI technology to offer deeper insights on payroll and HR to businesses. Using insights from ADP's knowledge database, business owners can get guidance on managing and growing their business through an intuitive, chat-based conversation right on their mobile device.\n\nThey can ask questions such as, \"Can you help me with a job description for a truck driver that we are hiring?\"; \"How should I conduct a new hire interview? What are some key questions I should ask?\"; \"When should payroll taxes be filed in the U.S.?\" and \"What are the advantages of contributing to a 401(k) plan compared to other investments?\"\n\nThe software issues reminders about important HR tasks and deadlines, \"remembering\" prior interactions and learning over time. The system understands both English and Spanish. It's now available in the U.S. and will be offered in Europe this fall.",

        "title": "I'm All Aboard AMD and Lisa Su's AI Train: Here's the Plan",
        "body": "If anyone is going to challenge Nvidia for market share in the generative AI-capable space, it's going to be AMD that makes the first truly serious attempt.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, long-time Sarge-fave Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) released that firm's second quarter financial results.\n\nFor the three month period ended July 1st, AMD posted an adjusted EPS of $0.58 (GAAP EPS: $0.02) on revenue of $5.359B. While both the adjusted earnings print and the revenue number managed slight beats of consensus view, that sales print did reflect a year over year contraction of 18.2%. The lion's share of the adjustments made were for the amortization of acquired intangible assets (think Xilinx), while stock based compensation also accounted for a chunk.\n\nMy opinion? That stock based compensation should be counted as an ordinary expense, especially for corporations that have been around a while. This has nothing to do with my opinion of this stock, it's just my opinion that there should be a standard, even for \"adjusting\" earnings.\n\nExplaining The Quarter\n\nUsing GAAP standards, gross profit was down 19% to $2.443B on a gross margin of 46%, which was flat from the year ago period. Operating expenses decreased by 1% to $2.471B, taking operating income down from $526M to $-20M as the firm's operating margin dropped from 8% to 0%. After factoring for interest and taxes, net income took a 94% hit from $447M down to $27M as GAAP EPS dropped from $0.27 to $0.02.\n\nMind you, I have no problem with adjusting earnings for things like the amortization of acquired intangible assets, which in this case accounted for $0.42 of the adjustment. Adjustments are necessary when there are one-time or special events that do impact the ability to compare results across different periods.\n\nNow, we'll go through the same motions above, but using the adjusted data. Adjusted gross profit was down 25% to $2665B on a gross margin of 50%, which was down from 54% for the year ago period. Operating expenses increased 3% to $1.605B, taking operating income down 46% from $1.982B to $1.068B as the firm's operating margin dropped from 30% to 20%. After factoring for interest and taxes, net income took a 44% hit from $1.707B down to $948M as adjusted EPS dropped from $1.05 to $0.58.\n\nThe CEO on AI\n\nIn the press release, CEO Lisa Su commented: \"We delivered strong results in the second quarter as 4th Gen Epyc and Ryzen 7000 processors ramped significantly. Our AI engagements increased by more than seven times in the quarters multiple customers initiated or expanded programs supporting future deployments of Instinct accelerations at scale.\"\n\nDuring the call, Su said: \"Our AI strategy is focused on three areas. First, deliver a broad portfolio and multi-generational roadmap of leadership GPUs, CPUs and adaptive computing solutions for AI inferencing. Second, expend the open and proven software platform we have established that enables our AI hardware to be deployed broadly and easily. And third, expand the deep and collaborative partnerships we have established across the ecosystem to accelerate deployments of AMD-based AI solutions at scale.\"\n\nSu added: \"Longer term, while we are still in the very early days of the new era of AI, it is clear that AI represents a multibillion dollar growth opportunity for AMD across cloud, edge and an increasingly diverse number of intelligent endpoints.\"\n\nSegment Performance\n\n- Data Center generated revenue of $1.321B (-11.1%), missing estimates. This produced operating income of $147M (-68.9%). Soft enterprise demand and elevated inventories at some cloud customers impacted this segment. The release later this year of the MI300A and MI 300X generative AI capable GPUs are expected to boost this business.\n\n- Client generated revenue of $998M (-53.6%), beating estimates. This produced operating income/loss of $-69M (down from $676M). Though down year over year, sales did improve 35% sequentially. AMD believes that this segment should return to profitability during the current quarter.\n\n- Gaming generated revenue of $1.581B (-4.5%), narrowly missing estimates. This produced operating income of $225M (+20.3%). Growth in semi-custom chips across the Gaming sector was slowed by a decrease in revenue driven by demand for gaming graphics GPUs.\n\n- Embedded generated revenue of $1.459B (+16.1%), missing estimates. This produced operating income of $757M (+18.1%). Then growth in this segment was driven by demand for Industrial, Healthcare, Automotive and testing purposes.\n\nGuidance\n\nFor the current quarter, AMD expects to drive revenue of $5.7B , give or take $300M, which puts the mid-point slightly below the $5.85B that Wall Street was looking for. The firm sees adjusted gross margin at 51%, which would be up sequentially from the second quarter's 50%.\n\nFundamentals\n\nFor the period reported, AMD generated operating cash flow of $379M, bringing the six month total up to $865M. Out of that comes CapEx of $125M for the quarter and $283M for the half-year. This brings Q2 free cash flow to $254M and H1 free cash flow to $582M. The firm did not return capital to shareholders during the second quarter after having repurchased $241M worth of common stock during the first quarter. The balance mostly went toward improving the balance sheet.\n\nSpeaking of said balance sheet, AMD ended the period with a cash position of $6.285B and inventories of $4.567B. Note that inventories are on the way back up as the firm prepares for a rush on their AI-capable chips later this year. This brought current assets to $16.505B. Current liabilities add up to $7.572B. This puts AMD's current ratio at 2.18, which is incredibly healthy, especially for a large firm in an industry that has struggled for a year. Even valuing all inventories at zero, which would not happen, AMD's quick ratio stands at 1.58. That's nice.\n\nTotal assets amount to $67.967B, of which $46.775B is goodwill and other intangibles. I would not normally be okay with intangibles making up 69% of total assets. The fact here is that $22.598B of those intangibles are acquisition-related and as we discussed above those assets are being amortized.\n\nTotal liabilities less equity comes to just $12.831B. The firm has just $2,467B worth of (long and short-term) debt on its balance sheet, which it could take care of more than twice over out of pocket. Make no mistake, AMD has a balance sheet to be envied and emulated.\n\nWall Street\n\nSince these earnings were released on Tuesday night, I have come across 14 sell-side analysts that are both rated at a minimum of four stars by TipRanks and have opined on AMD. After allowing for changes, there are 12 \"buy\" or buy-equivalent ratings and two \"hold\" or hold-equivalent ratings. One of the \"buys\" failed to publish a target price so we are working with 13 targets. The average target price for AMD across out 13 analysts is $142.77, with a high of $170 (Tristan Gerra of Robert W. Baird) and a low of $95 (Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein). Once those two are omitted as potential outliers, the average target price across the other 11 rises to $144.64. For those that might be curious, the \"buy\" ratings in isolation, average a target of $148.27.\n\nMy Thoughts\n\nThere is no denying that across a majority of the firm's businesses, AMD has struggled this year and especially this past quarter. That said, these second quarter numbers were better than feared and significant free cash flow was still generated.\n\nThe guidance was slightly light. That said, it really is all about generative AI and implementing the new chips probably in the fourth quarter across the firm's field of clientele. There's the Fitch downgrade of US sovereign debt, but the kibosh on AMD's off-hours rally, not to mention equity markets this morning at large.\n\nStill, if anyone is going to challenge Nvidia (NVDA) for market share in the generative AI-capable space, it is going to be AMD that makes the first truly serious attempt.\n\nReaders will see that AMD had rallied 143% from the stock's October 2022 low through the early June 2023 high. The shares tried that top twice, and then found support close to a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of that entire run. A basing period of consolidation ensued.\n\nThe shares were under pressure this morning, with the possibility of losing both its 50 day SMA (simple moving average) ($116) and 21 day EMA (exponential moving average) ($113) all in the same day. Neither Relative Strength nor the stock's daily MACD (moving average convergence divergence) appear to be anything more than neutral.\n\nNeedless to say, I am all aboard the Lisa Su AI train going forward. My thinking is that even at a 41 times forward looking earnings multiple that AMD is still inevitable. I am still up over 90% versus my net basis and I have taken some profits along the way, not as much as I have taken in Nvidia, but I am okay.\n\nMy Current Plan for AMD\n\n- Target Price: $153\n\n- Pivot: $133\n\n- Add: Down to $107\n\n- Panic: When $107 support cracks.",

        "body": "The governor of the Bank of Albania Gent Sejko, in a statement to the media, said that the Albanian economy is expected to grow in the coming years. He added that the Bank of Albania will continue to support the country's economic growth in the future.\n\nSejko also underlined the devaluation of the euro, stressing that the strengthening of the lek has helped reduce foreign inflationary pressures.\n\n\"The Albanian economy is expected to grow in the coming years, while inflation is expected to return to the target in the middle of next year. In these circumstances, the Supervisory Council of the Bank of Albania decided to keep the stance of the monetary policy unchanged. The banking sector will continue to support economic growth in the future as well. The exchange rate of the lek against the euro has continued to strengthen in 2023. This strengthening recorded an average value of 8.5% during the second three months and accelerated further in July, registering a value of 12.1%. The strengthening direction of the exchange rate is in line with the confidence of the economic and financial balance from abroad, influenced by the rapid growth of income from tourism and by the high values of foreign direct investments. The strengthening of the lek has helped to reduce foreign inflationary pressures and enabled a slower normalization of interest rates.\n\nHowever, the velocity of the exchange rate remains high and fluctuations in the foreign exchange market have increased recently. The trends observed in the first half of the year will continue to be present in the future. According to the basic scenario, the Albanian economy is expected to continue growing over the next three months and the years to come. This is as a result of the economic slowdown in the Eurozone and tighter financing conditions both in the country and in the world. Inflation is expected to fall during the next three months and return to the target in the middle of next year,\" he said.",

After careful consideration, Hudson's Bay has made the decision to close its Lougheed location.\"\n\nBourr\u00e9 said \"transfer opportunities\" for Lougheed store employees \"will be explored where feasible.\"\n\nThe Bay's three surrounding stores at Metrotown, Coquitlam Centre and Guildford Town Centre in Surrey will remain open.\n\nThe Lougheed Hudson's Bay is now selling its merchandise at discount prices; store fixtures are also for sale.\n\nThe NOW has reached out to Shape Properties Corp., the current owner and developer of the City of Lougheed, for details on the future of the 125,400 sq. ft. leased shopfront and is waiting to hear back.\n\nThere are currently 85 Hudson's Bay brick-and-mortar stores, according to HBC.com, down from 89 stores in February 2019.\n\nHudson's Bay Co. has laid off 500 corporate employees this year.\n\nThe last public reporting period showed Hudson's Bay made $5.47 billion in retail sales as of November 2019's third quarter.\n\nIn 2021, the company separated its brick-and-mortar stores as \"Hudson's Bay\" from its online e-commerce brand \"The Bay.\"\n\nFormerly a public company, Hudson's Bay went private in March 2020.\n\nlvanderdeen@burnabynow.com\n\ntwitter.com/lauvande",

        "title": "Virgin Media O2 claims UK 5G SA private network first | Computer We...",
        "body": "Low-cost plug-and-play private network launched to unlock connectivity for industries whenever and wherever they need it\n\nThe increased roll-out of 5G infrastructures across the world has led to the subsequent demand for private networks whose value to industries of varying form has now well been proven, and in an evolution of what is still a very nascent market, Virgin Media O2 Business (VMO2B) is claiming a first in the UK with a portable commercial 5G standalone (SA) private network (PN).\n\nOnce plugged in, the portable network - said to be only slightly larger than a carry-on airline bag - is designed to enable companies to immediately access 5G connectivity at the flick of a switch, without the time and expense of building an entire network. VMO2B believes that with a network that can be easily used and activated, not just by telecoms engineers, the product enables businesses of all sizes to access private connectivity. This, said the company, means organisations from tech startups to large companies will be able to tap into a secure 5G network quickly, and in a way that fits their needs.\n\nSince the first trials of the portable offering, VMO2B has developed and deployed two 5G SA PN platforms. Wayra, the innovation arm of global telco Telef\u00f3nica, was home to the first trial of the product, and has been using the network since last summer, enabling customers and small businesses to experience 5G SA-enabled applications first-hand.\n\nStartups based in Wayra's London office using the offering include Mobilus Labs, an organisation using advanced voice technology to enable industrial teams to communicate in environments with extreme noise. To ensure safe interactions between people and devices on sites like construction, manufacturing and healthcare locations, Mobilus Labs requires fast internet speeds and secure connections which private 5G networks can provide. Further trials with companies offering products ranging from virtual reality (VR) applications to internet of things (IoT) services are said to have already shown benefits including high reliability, enhanced data security and ultra-low latency.\n\nThe applications and features are activated using Nokia Digital Automation Cloud and Nokia MX Industrial Edge, which allows organisations like Mobilus Labs to safely support mission-critical applications. VMO2B said the integration makes it the UK's first telco to incorporate MXIE into its private wireless offering. With on-premise edge cloud capabilities, enterprises can process data at the source in real time, meaning business-critical applications do not need to communicate back to an application in the public cloud.\n\nThis is said to remove the complexity and economic hurdles typically associated with mission-critical networking, meaning the offering can support digital transformation for businesses across sectors including manufacturing, construction and healthcare.\n\n\"At Mobilus Labs, we are making industrial teams more connected through clear voice communications,\" said Mobilus Labs chief technology officer Tony Blackburn. \"The portable 5G standalone private network will unlock access to super-fast internet connectivity across industrial sites. Having trialled Virgin Media O2 Business's solution, we believe it will enable mobiTALK, our push-to-talk smart phone application, to offer a seamless customer experience.\"\n\nVirgin Media O2 Business managing director Jo Bertram added: \"Britain is a hub for innovation, so it's crucial that companies operating here can access the connectivity needed to create new experiences for customers. From startups to large enterprises, our latest network solution will enable 5G trials and deployment without the time or cost of building a whole network. Removing barriers, like location and cost, to ensure that businesses get the connection they need.\"\n\nWayra UK managing director Bruno Moraes said: \"Reliable, fast, precise, on-demand connectivity is a must for all businesses, especially those in the most challenging environments, such as hospitals and construction sites.\n\n\"This plug-and-play private network unlocks reliable and low-cost connectivity for those industries whenever and wherever they need it, which is game-changing. In partnership with Virgin Media O2, we are collaborating with corporate customers and startups in these areas to test this network and build new products on the foundation of new levels of connectivity.\"",

        "title": "Why ACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR) Could Be Worth Watching",
        "body": "ACM Research, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACMR), might not be a large cap stock, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGM over the last few months. As a stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company's outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on ACM Research's outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for ACM Research\n\nGreat news for investors - ACM Research is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I've used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock's cash flows. I find that ACM Research's ratio of 14.61x is below its peer average of 24.02x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Semiconductor industry. However, given that ACM Research's share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it's the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. ACM Research's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 50%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nAre you a shareholder? Since ACMR is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you've been keeping an eye on ACMR for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future profit outlook isn't fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it's not too late to buy ACMR. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed assessment.\n\nIf you'd like to know more about ACM Research as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with ACM Research, and understanding this should be part of your investment process.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in ACM Research, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.",

        "body": "....As Okotete rolls out laudable achievements in NEXIM Bank\n\nBy George Mgbeleke\n\nThe Senate, on Tuesday, acknowledged the laudable achievements of the Executive Director (Business Development) of Nigerian Export and Import Bank (NEXIM), Hon. Stella Okotete, in growing the non oil exports and business fortunes of the Bank.\n\nThe commendation came after the Senator representing Delta Central, Senator Ede Dafinone moved a motion at the ongoing ministerial screening exercise, urging his colleagues to allow Ms. Okotete take a bow and leave.\n\nHon. Okotete, former National Women Leader of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) and currently serving as ED Business Development at NEXIM Bank, was President Bola Tinubu's ministerial nominee from Delta State.\n\nSenator Dafinone, while moving the motion, said he had had opportunity of working with Ms. Okotete during his one year stay as Non-Executive Director with NEXIM, adding that the nominee was the engine room of the international reputable bank.\n\n\"What the nominee did not mention was that, her position as the Executive Director of Business Development Unit, means she was at the engine room of the bank. The Business Development Unit, is the operational department of the NEXIM Bank. So, she was in charge of the operations of the Bank and in that capacity, she was able to grow the balance sheet of the Bank and she has done exceptionally well.\n\n\"I want to add also, that as a young woman, she has also favoured the youth and women in her policies at the bank, aside the policies she had done at home, encouraging young people in various departments and empowerment programs.\n\n\"She has also been instrumental in growing non oil exports and as at today, the non oil exports are the key focus of this administration, as we protect the need to grow our economy in the background of dwindling oil reserves and in move globally away from foisting fuel, to a more sustainable forms of energy.\n\n\"My Colleagues said she has distinguished herself already, what I need to add is that, I speak for my 2 Colleagues from Delta State who are both fully in support of the nominee, and to ask Distinguished Members, if the nominee from Delta State, could please be recognized for her good work in NEXIM Bank, with the background that, she has served one complete term at NEXIM Bank and that the term has been renewed about a year ago, which shows she has distinguished herself at the Bank. With that Mr. President, I urge that Distinguished Members, do ask the nominee from Delta State to please take a bow\", Senator Dafinone told his Colleagues.\n\nPresident of the Senate, Senator Godswill Akpabio, who presided over the ministerial screening, also attested to the role of Ms. Okotete in women and youth development as the Women Leader of the ruling party, APC.\n\nHe said, \"honestly, when she mentioned that she was a women leader of the greatest party in Africa, I just remembered that we are all from political parties and in normal circumstances, the party is supreme\".\n\nAkpabio also went further to poll the question for the nominee to take a bow and the response was in affirmative with overwhelming and resounding AYES.\n\nEarlier, while giving a short profile of herself, the nominee, who was born in 1984, took the Senate through the journey of her career and achievements recorded, especially in women and youth development, as well as her exploits at the NEXIM Bank.\n\nHer words:\n\n\"The immediate past President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammad Buhari, in 2017, found me worthy and appointed me, in line with the Act of Export and Import Bank, sections 11, 8 and 14 , as Executive Director of Nigerian Export-Import Bank (NEXIM Bank), in charge of Business Development.\n\n\"The functions of the ED Business Development of the Bank, which I still hold till date, is to drive the business directorate of the Bank, to create quality risk assets and to also provide funding for exporters in the non-oil sector.\n\n\"When we resumed in 2017, we met a balance sheet size of N67bn. We had grown it to N256bn by 2022, when our tenure got renewed. We also met a bank that was already recording loses, year-in, year-out for 3 years. As at 2016, the bank had recorded over N6bn losses. Today, the Nigerian Export and Import Bank is standing shoulder-to-shoulder with other global export banks and profitably as one of the leading export credit institutions in Africa.\n\n\"I was also the women representative, popularly known as the Women leader of the All Progressive Congress (APC) Caretaker Committee in 2020.\n\n\"As Women Leader of the ruling All Progressive Congress at that time, I was able to bring to bear, quality representation to our women and we established new policy that helped shaped visibility for our women across board.\n\n\"One of it is the Progressive Women Academy, which was approved by the Apple Store and Google Store. It is an online academy where women can learn various self skills to make themselves not just visible in the business space but also in politics. I also understood, being a very young politician, that there was need to build bridges across the older women in politics and the younger ones, and I established the Progressive Young Women's Forum, which was also a platform to groom future female Leaders and mentor them.\n\n\"I'm proud to say today that I have women who were part of my mentes, serving as Commissioners, elected as House of Assembly Members and also as Councilors and some of them are Special Advisers and Special Assistants currently at various state levels.\n\n\"I also created the lobby group of the APC Women and we were able to garvanise stakeholders to accept the responsibility to push for more visibility for our women. Based on that, when we did the review of the APC constitution, we were able to accomodate another seat for a woman in the NWC. Today, that's the only party in Africa that gives 2 seats - Women Leader and Deputy Women Leader seats in the NWC.\n\n\"By the grace of God, I was also able to influence such platforms for women across the party structures at the state, local government and senatorial districts\".",

        "body": "Nykaa said Nayar will lead the marketing function at the startup and also announced multiple new appointments\n\nSix executives of beauty and fashion ecommerce giant Nykaa, including its marketing head, have reportedly resigned since April this year, following which founder and CEO Falguni Nayar will now spearhead the marketing department at the startup.\n\nNykaa has seen the exits of chief marketing officer Shalini Raghavan, senior vice president (VP) for retail Kingshuk Basu, senior VP in the fashion unit Sumant Kasliwal, VP Sachin Kataria of ecommerce business, VP for marketing and communications Shantanu Prakash, and Aditya Sandhu of business-to-business sales unit in the last few months, Reuters reported.\n\nNykaa didn't directly comment on the departures in a statement sent to Inc42. \"As Nykaa evolves into a multi-dimensional, multi-geographic business, leadership roles are being augmented with an eye on strategic realignment, cost rationalisation and growing complexity of the business,\" it said.\n\n\"Given the criticality of the marketing function to One Nykaa, founder and CEO, Falguni Nayar will guide the function directly,\" the statement added.\n\nAs part of these developments, Nykaa said it elevated Shailendra Singh as business head for physical retail - beauty in June, while he also continues to lead key omnichannel initiatives.\n\n\"We're excited to bring a strategic leader in Rozita Nouruzi as the CEO of Nysaa, our omnichannel beauty business in partnership with the Apparel Group in the GCC,\" the statement said.\n\nNykaa also said that it has hired a new leader to drive the next phase of growth for Nykaa Fashion owned western-wear brands.\n\nThe development comes at a time when Nykaa has aggressively started revisiting and restructuring its business model amid dwindling profit numbers and rising market competition.\n\nIn March this year, Nykaa saw the departure of five senior executives, including its chief commercial operations officer Manoj Gandhi and chief business officer of fashion division Gopal Asthana.\n\nFollowing this, in April, Nykaa onboarded new senior leaders across its technology, finance, business, and marketing teams to spearhead the next phase of growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the entry of Reliance Retail into the beauty and personal care (BPC) market with its omnichannel platform Tira has come as a major challenge for Nykaa, which had started taking a leading position in this segment.\n\nOn the other hand, Nykaa's fashion business is also facing pressure due to the competition from deep-pocketed players like AJIO and Tata CLiQ.\n\nDuring the company's Q4 FY23 results announcement, Nayar emphasised that Nykaa was not chasing the highest possible growth for its fashion vertical but the \"right growth\", which wouldn't dilute what the platform has to offer in terms of \"uniqueness\".\n\nSome of the major metrics for Nykaa's BPC and fashion businesses, including its gross merchandise value (GMV), saw a sharp decline on a sequential basis in Q4.\n\nNykaa's net profit plummeted 70% year-on-year (YoY) to INR 2.3 Cr in the last reported quarter. The company is expected to announce its Q1 FY24 results on August 11.\n\nShares of Nykaa ended today's session 0.6% lower at INR 147 on the BSE.",

        "body": "Ripple executives and XRP holders are discussing tax implications for using the coin in cross-currency payments. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pomerdoge (POMD) posted gains on the weekly charts. On the other hand, analysts continue to debate about high-value altcoins in 2023.\n\nDogecoin is up 6.6% in the last week of trading, rising 18.1% in the previous month.\n\nAs of July 31, 2023, DOGE traded at $0.079620 with a market cap of $11.17 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $391.62 million, a 21.94% increase.\n\nRising trading volumes suggest that DOGE may grow in the days ahead, a reason why more investors are placing bullish bets on the coin.\n\nSome predict DOGE may hit $0.10 by year-end.\n\nFredo Ayala, who works with accounting and finance, started a conversation on Twitter.\n\nHe said taxes would only affect customers if they settle XRP transactions on-chain without price changes. However, if prices change while the transaction is being initiated, it could lead to more or fewer taxable events.\n\nNeil Hartner, a software engineer at Ripple, explained a situation involving converting USD to EUR using XRP in between. Mark Hamilton, who used to work at Ripple, compared this with how regular banks handle transactions.\n\nAs of July 31, 2023, XRP is trading at $0.7038. Its market cap rose to around $37 billion with a 24-hour trading volume of approximately $1.3 billion.\n\nIn the last month, XRP is up roughly 50%, with traders forecasting the coin to hit $0.93 by the end of the year.\n\nPomerdoge is bullish on the monthly chart and experts expect more gains going forward.\n\nThe Pomerdoge ecosystem targets play-to-earn (P2E) web3 users and offers value to players and investors. Its multifaceted platform includes Pomergame, a virtual world with engaging gameplay designed to attract global gamers.\n\nPlayers can create avatars, level them up, enhance their capabilities, and collect valuable in-game items. Additionally, Pomerplace is a dedicated marketplace enabling the buying, selling, and trading of in-game assets.\n\nThe platform will also have a distinct non-fungible token (NFT) collection comprising 7,777 unique NFTs accessible to POMD token holders.\n\nThese NFTs are each priced at 0.2 ETH.\n\nThe Pomerdoge team maintains an ongoing development effort, targeting a Q4 2023 release for the ecosystem.\n\nCurrently, POMD is available at $0.007 in the ongoing presale.\n\nIn 2023, XRP and DOGE garnered substantial investor interest.\n\nHowever, Pomerdoge might surge in the days ahead due to its robust ecosystem.\n\nIts play-to-earn concept can attract a broad audience, allowing players to earn while they engage.\n\nPOMD, its native token, drives all platform transactions, providing holders with practical functionality and rewards from staking.\n\nAs such, investors looking to diversify their portfolios can consider Pomerdoge a viable option at spot rates.",

        "body": "Ripple executives and XRP holders are discussing tax implications for using the coin in cross-currency payments. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pomerdoge (POMD) posted gains on the weekly charts. On the other hand, analysts continue to debate about high-value altcoins in 2023.\n\nDogecoin is up 6.6% in the last week of trading, rising 18.1% in the previous month.\n\nAs of July 31, 2023, DOGE traded at $0.079620 with a market cap of $11.17 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $391.62 million, a 21.94% increase.\n\nRising trading volumes suggest that DOGE may grow in the days ahead, a reason why more investors are placing bullish bets on the coin.\n\nSome predict DOGE may hit $0.10 by year-end.\n\nFredo Ayala, who works with accounting and finance, started a conversation on Twitter.\n\nHe said taxes would only affect customers if they settle XRP transactions on-chain without price changes. However, if prices change while the transaction is being initiated, it could lead to more or fewer taxable events.\n\nNeil Hartner, a software engineer at Ripple, explained a situation involving converting USD to EUR using XRP in between. Mark Hamilton, who used to work at Ripple, compared this with how regular banks handle transactions.\n\nAs of July 31, 2023, XRP is trading at $0.7038. Its market cap rose to around $37 billion with a 24-hour trading volume of approximately $1.3 billion.\n\nIn the last month, XRP is up roughly 50%, with traders forecasting the coin to hit $0.93 by the end of the year.\n\nPomerdoge is bullish on the monthly chart and experts expect more gains going forward.\n\nThe Pomerdoge ecosystem targets play-to-earn (P2E) web3 users and offers value to players and investors. Its multifaceted platform includes Pomergame, a virtual world with engaging gameplay designed to attract global gamers.\n\nPlayers can create avatars, level them up, enhance their capabilities, and collect valuable in-game items. Additionally, Pomerplace is a dedicated marketplace enabling the buying, selling, and trading of in-game assets.\n\nThe platform will also have a distinct non-fungible token (NFT) collection comprising 7,777 unique NFTs accessible to POMD token holders.\n\nThese NFTs are each priced at 0.2 ETH.\n\nThe Pomerdoge team maintains an ongoing development effort, targeting a Q4 2023 release for the ecosystem.\n\nCurrently, POMD is available at $0.007 in the ongoing presale.\n\nIn 2023, XRP and DOGE garnered substantial investor interest.\n\nHowever, Pomerdoge might surge in the days ahead due to its robust ecosystem.\n\nIts play-to-earn concept can attract a broad audience, allowing players to earn while they engage.\n\nPOMD, its native token, drives all platform transactions, providing holders with practical functionality and rewards from staking.\n\nAs such, investors looking to diversify their portfolios can consider Pomerdoge a viable option at spot rates.",

        "body": "The Microsoft Teams desktop app now supports spatial audio for meetings. Microsoft believes the feature can help meeting participants keep track of who is speaking by better separating the voices of all users in the meeting.\n\n\"Teams Spatial Audio aligns the perceived audio location of each participant with their video representation to make it easier for users to track who is speaking, to understand better when multiple speakers are speaking at the same time, and to lower meeting fatigue and cognitive load,\" Microsoft explained. In short, instead of using a single audio channel that only provides monophonic audio, spatial audio recreates what we experience during in-person conversations.\n\nSpatial audio can be enabled in Settings > Devices in the Teams desktop app. The feature is currently only compatible with stereo speakers and wired stereo headsets, and Bluetooth headsets are currently not supported to a protocol limitation. Microsoft said that Bluetooth devices that support the next-gen Bluetooth LE standard will eventually be supported.\n\nMicrosoft also mentioned other limitations: Teams currently doesn't support receiving music mode in spatial audio, and the feature is also not supported for users in listening mode connected to a satellite server. In meetings with more than 100 users, users in listening mode can be moved to a satellite server while users who speak do so via a central media server that does support spatial audio.\n\nThere's no word yet on when spatial audio will be supported on the Teams web and mobile apps. However, Microsoft hopes that this feature will help to make video meetings more pleasurable for all participants. \"While we cannot guarantee it will turn your next meeting into a posh event with fancy beverages and riveting small talk, we think you will find that Spatial Audio feels more natural and engaging,\" the company said.",

        "body": "Worldcoin is set to expand its iris-scanning technology to companies and governments, offering solutions for identity management and promotional use.\n\nWorldcoin, known for its controversial blockchain-based iris-scanning identity technology, has revealed plans to allow governments and companies to utilize its system for identity verification and other applications, according to a Reuters report.\n\n\"Worldcoin will expand its operations to sign up more users globally and aims to allow other organisations to use its iris-scanning and identity-verifying technology.\"\n\nThe San Francisco and Berlin-based company, Tools For Humanity, has successfully enlisted 2.2 million users, employing a spherical \"orb\" to conduct iris scans.\n\nThe applications for governments and companies are diverse. Worldcoin's technology could enable companies to administer promotions without having to collect personal data, Reuters explained. A coffee shop could offer free coffee and use Worldcoin's system to ensure people don't claim more than one, without gathering any personal information outside of the person's Worldcoin proof-of-personhood.\n\nGovernments, too, may explore the system's possibilities. Ricardo Macieira, the general manager for Europe at Tools For Humanity, explained to Reuters the potential applications for Worldcoin, such as infrastructure for universal basic income and enabling global democratic processes, although no specific plans or guarantees were made.\n\nThe technology behind the iris-scanning orb will become open-source, according to Macieira, fostering further innovation and adaptation by third parties.\n\nAlready, 2.2 million individuals have signed up for digital IDs, and in some regions, free cryptocurrency, via Worldcoin's shiny spherical orb. Macieira said that the expansion would target Europe, Latin America, Africa, and other accepting regions:\n\n\"'The idea is that as we build this infrastructure and that we allow other third parties to use the technology [...] The idea is that anyone can in the future build their own orb and use it to benefit the community that it's aiming for.'\"\n\nVenture capital investors, including Blockchain Capital, a16z crypto, Bain Capital Crypto, and Distributed Global, contributed $115 million in a funding round in May to the project. Worldcoin's website hints at various applications like enabling \"global democratic processes\" and other authentication use-cases.\n\nDespite the technological promise, data regulators in Britain, France, Germany, and the European Union's Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision have expressed concerns and are investigating the project. Kenya, meanwhile, has banned Worldcoin until further notice, effective on August 2.\n\nAnd, backlash toward this company has been apparent since its company announcement in 2021.\n\nThe Worldcoin Foundation assured compliance with personal data laws, saying that the \"project is 'completely private' and that the biometric data is either deleted or users can opt to have it stored in encrypted form.\"",

        "title": "Onderzoekers willen cement in fundering inzetten als accumateriaal",
        "body": "Onderzoekers hebben een manier gevonden om van cement een supercondensator te maken. Hierdoor zou het mogelijk zijn om hier elektriciteit in op te slaan en kunnen in theorie van woningfunderingen en wegen relatief goedkope accu's gemaakt worden.\n\nHet onderzoek, dat is uitgevoerd door het Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is gepubliceerd in het wetenschappelijke tijdschrift PNAS. Voor het cre\u00ebren van de supercondensator is, naast cementpoeder, water en zwarte koolstof gebruikt. Cement geleidt op zichzelf namelijk niet heel goed, maar zwarte koolstof wel. Bovendien is het laatstgenoemde materiaal relatief goedkoop.\n\nAls deze materialen op een specifieke manier gecombineerd worden, ontstaat er een geleidend nanocomposiet. Dat komt doordat het water makkelijk combineert met de cementpoeder, maar de deeltjes zwarte koolstof water juist afstoten en vervolgens samenklonteren. Daardoor ontstaan 'rankachtige' vormen in het harder wordende cement die kunnen fungeren als een netwerk van draden. Het cement wordt vervolgens in dunne platen gesneden. Als er daarna een membraan en electrolyt aan worden toegevoegd, bijvoorbeeld kaliumchloride, moet de condensator in staat zijn om energie op te slaan en los te laten.\n\nHier is wel een hoop cement voor nodig. Voor 10kWh, genoeg om een gemiddeld huishouden een dag van stroom te voorzien, is naar verwachting 45 kuub vereist. Dat is ongeveer evenveel als gebruikt wordt voor de fundering van een standaardwoonhuis. De cementcondensators die de onderzoekers hebben gecre\u00eberd, van 1mm dik en 1cm breed, hadden genoeg vermogen om een paar ledlampjes te laten branden.\n\nHet onderzoeksteam denkt dat, als dezelfde methode wordt gebruikt voor het bouwen van wegen en parkeerplaatsen, het elektrische beton in theorie hernieuwbare energie kan opslaan en via inductieladen kan leveren aan elektrische auto's. Omdat de materialen in vergelijking met andere thuisaccu's relatief goedkoop zijn, is dit ook mogelijk een manier voor derdewereldlanden om groene energie op te slaan.\n\nDe groep heeft de technologie gepatenteerd en probeert deze nu op te schalen. Dat is geen eenvoudige klus, stelt het team. Als supercondensators in grootte toenemen, neemt hun elektrische geleidbaarheid doorgaans af. Het eerstvolgende doel is om de cementcondensator even krachtig te maken als een autoaccu van 12V.",

        "body": "By PAT EATON-ROBB - Associated Press\n\nHAMDEN, Conn. (AP) -- Santino Iamunno was born without most of his right hand, and the 11-year-old tends to keep that hand in his pocket when around new people, just to avoid the questions.\n\nBut that's not something he worries about at Camp No Limits, where all the young campers are dealing with limb loss or limb differences.\n\n\"It feels nice because I don't have to, like, explain what happened that often,\" Santino said. \"Because outside of camp, I'll get a lot of questions like, 'What happened?' And I mean, I'll explain it to them. But here, it's better here, because I don't have to.\"\n\nFounded in 2004, Camp No Limits holds sessions in Maine, Missouri, Maryland, Florida, Idaho, Arizona, Texas, California and a special one in Connecticut, where the counselors are physical and occupational therapy students at Quinnipiac University, a private liberal arts school with about 3,000 undergraduate students.\n\nPeople are also reading...

They also can challenge themselves physically with activities such as learning or relearning how to ride a bicycle and trying out sled hockey.\n\nJeni Rhodes' 8-year-old daughter Anya lost her left leg to cancer. She said seeing Anya push herself at camp to overcome obstacles and experience joy again has been special.\n\n\"She was able to get on a bike today and for the first time since her amputation last year,\" Rhodes said. \"So it's a big opportunity not only to just be around other people and differences, but also for her to try new things.\"\n\nMany of the campers are accompanied by parents and siblings who also stay overnight, participate in some of the activities and create bonds with other families.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nRosanne Keep, of North Wales, Pennsylvania, came with her 12-year-old daughter Mariam, who was born with a congenital condition that led to the amputation of her right foot in January. She said the opportunity to meet other kids with limb differences and their families has been good for both her daughter and her.\n\n\"There are other kids out there, but depending on what circles you travel in, you just don't see them that often,\" Rosanne Keep said. \"So it's a good opportunity for her to meet some other kids, talk about, you know, what they're going through, and also just as parents to meet other parents who are facing the same difficulties. It's just good mentally.\"\n\nThe camps are staffed with physical and occupational therapists, prosthetists and adult amputee mentors.\n\nQuinnipiac's camp is also a learning experience for the student counselors. It's the only such partnership Camp No Limits has with a university. And the Quinnipiac camp gets visits each year from prosthetist students from the University of Hartford, so they can also both teach and learn from the kids.\n\n\"I love that we're able to do this connection,\" said Mary Leighton, a physical therapist and the camp's founder and executive director. \"When I was in school, we really had a very limited amount of time that was spent discussing amputees or individuals with limb differences.\"\n\nThe camp experience is much more than just the practical application of what the students have been learning in the classroom, said Maria Cusson, a clinical associate professor of physical therapy at Quinnipiac.\n\n\"That personal connection, learning the stories of the campers, helping, you know, helping these kids and finding out who they are helps (the counselors) develop as students,\" Cusson said. \"It is more impactful than you can possibly imagine.\"\n\nOccupational therapy student Tessa Maloney, one of the camp's student leaders, said she had a career epiphany while working as a counselor. She was watching the camp talent show when a 16-year-old boy she had been working with took the stage.\n\nWith the Olympic theme playing in the background, the teen, who had recently lost most of one leg to cancer, proceeded to climb a flight of stairs. That brought tears to Tessa's eyes and convinced her that she should make a career of helping kids with limb differences.\n\n\"That was such a big step for him,\" she said. \"He couldn't do that before he came to camp. That was something that he worked on while he was here, and he felt confident enough in that new ability to do it in front of everyone. And it was just really inspiring.\"\n\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "body": "May, the estranged first wife of famous Nollywood actor Yul Edochie, has finally dragged her husband and his second wife, Judy Austin, to court\n\nThe brand and lifestyle influencer was reported to have demanded N100m in damages in her suit against Judy for committing adultery with her husband\n\nMay, in her suit, noted that she and Yul married under the 1970 Marriage Act, which indicated that neither a man nor woman can have more than one wife/husband at a time\n\nThis might be the most anticipated news within the Nigerian entertainment space as many may say they have been waiting to hear that Yul Edochie's first wife, May, has finally filed for divorce to leave her husband.\n\nIn a post by the Divorce blog that has gone viral on Facebook, DPA Family Law Clinic revealed the details of May Edochie's lawsuit and why it took so long before she filed for a divorce.\n\nIt was also revealed in detail why May considers Yul's marriage to Judy null because her husband married her under the 1970 marriage act and isn't allowed to have more than one wife at a time, unlike the customary marriage act. The lengthy post revealed that Yul was recently at his former matrimonial home, which he used to share with May but was denied entry.\n\nThe post also shared that Femi Falana's law firm and Eculaw represent May in court. It is reported that in her lawsuit, May noted that her husband seems to be under some kind of influence and has been unusually aggressive, erratic, irrational and increasingly threatening. She is said to have filed a separate charge against Judy for committing adultery with her husband and has demanded N100m in damages.\n\nYUL EDOCHIE'S SITUATION: UNDERSTANDING THE REALITY OF IT\n\nI have not seen in recent times a case where so much is going on, and yet not much is known to the public despite the intense public interest.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubts, May Yul-Edochie filed a divorce petition against Yul. She also filed against Judy as a party cited and she is asking for 100 million naira in damages against Judy for adultery with her husband. Make no mistake about it: Yul and Judy are NOT husband and wife, and cannot be so until Yul and May are divorced. It is a combination of delusion and absurdity for the two to call themselves husband and wife yet.\n\nBoth Judy and Yul are aware of the lawsuit, having received copies of the suit papers by email.\n\nSurprisingly, both Yul and Judy are avoiding service of the process upon them. The court bailiff has tried so many times to serve them in accordance with the rules of court. But they have evaded service of court process. Despite the braggadocio and the social media stunts, Yul Edochie and Judy are facing serious legal challenges and they seem ill-prepared for them, given the fact that they have been evading service of process.\n\nIn addition to the substantive petition, May also filed for an order of court restraining Yul from accessing their former matrimonial home. That application is based on the fact that there are genuine security and safety concerns. Yul's behavior has been erratic, irrational, aggressive and increasingly threatening. He seems to have been under some influence, the full extent or scope of which we are yet to ascertain. But measures are being taken to protect May and her children. These measures are proportionate to the threats.\n\nDespite the combination of circumstances at the present time, last weekend, against all advice, Yul attempted to access the home, now occupied alone by May and her children. But he was stopped by the intervention of law enforcement. He was reminded that henceforth all issues involving his marriage to May and dealings in that regard are subjudice. He should consult his lawyer, when and if he hires one, and be guided by such lawyer.\n\nAfter the event of last weekend, it was not surprising at all to hear that Yul and Judy would be on social media in a commic display where Judy showers Yul with unfettered adulation, calling him Odogwu, the best in Africa and fountain head. It is totally understandable that he would need such extreme ego massage.\n\nAs the world can attest by now, May is the sharp opposit of Yul and Judy. She is calm, rational and incredibly stoic. Despite the enormous losses and suffering she has endured lately, she held on to high values of honor and integrity and remains calm and focused in face of turbulence. She has earned the respect and admiration of many good people.\n\nDPA Family Law Clinic remains committed to supporting her through the storm.\n\nNOTE: May is represented in court by Femi Falana's Firm and Eculaw Group. Our Family Law Clinic plays a support role aside from litigation activities.\n\nMARRIAGE IS MARRIAGE, AND ADULTERY IS ADULTERY\n\nYou cannot turn adultery into a marriage just because the adulterous couple call themselves husband and wife. But that is exactly what Yul Edochie and Judy Austin have tried to do. We are surprised that some people would buy into it.\n\nIf we allow Yul and Judy to get away with such absurdity, it will amount to us turning everything upside down. Then the term adultery will have no meaning in law.\n\nThe fact is that Yul and May elected to marry under the Marriage Act 1970 Laws of Nigeria. The most essential consequence of marrying under that law is that it is a crime to have two wives or two husbands at the same time. Those who want to have two wives DO NOT marry under the Marriage Act. Instead, they marry under customary law. This is a decision everybody makes during his first marriage - to marry under the Marriage Act or under the Customary Law. Once you make your choice, you're bound by it.\n\nQueen May cannot be forced into a polygamous marriage. That's what this is all about. She doesn't want to be forced into a polygamous marriage. What Yul is doing with Judy remains adultery. The relationship between Yul and Judy is purely adulterous. Not wanting to play along with that, May has filed for divorce and she demands for damages against the woman that committed adultery with her husband.\n\nAs you can see, May took her time. She did not rush to file for divorce as many would have expected. First, she had to deal with the shock of realizing that her husband had been living a double life for years and had been able to conceal it, using the nature of his work to conceal it. Second, she sensed that her husband could have been under some influence and her primary instinct was to try to save him from such influence. Third, she had to allow time for both families which were all equally shocked to wade into the matter. Fourthly, she had to assess how this whole development would affect their children and she wanted to minimize the shock impact on the children. And unfortunately, she lost her son in the midst of all that. In these circumstances, it was justified for May to take some time before taking a definitive step to end the marriage.\n\nMay has shown wisdom, discipline and maturity in handling the situation. She is well coordinated. If there is anybody that has lost his balance, it is Yul. He did so long ago.\n\nHaving said that, the challenges the family is going through is enormous. Left for May, she wants a peaceful dissolution of the marriage and she is ready to move on with her life and to remain the best mother she could be. It is quite unfortunate that Yul and Judy, through their unbecoming media stunts, have chosen to constitute public nuisance as their way of making a wrong appear right.\n\nWe would have asked the public to allow the family peace and tranquility to deal with their challenges. But we understand how difficult that would be given the fact that Yul and Judy are everywhere trying to attract public attention to their extreme absurdity.\n\nQueen May will remain calm and focused. She remains grateful to God. And she appreciates the continous flow of goodwill from well-wishers.",

        "body": "Coming soon from Apple - the world's leading smartphone manufacturer, is their first foldable phone, which will likely be called the iPhone Flip.\n\nHere is a closer look at what we know so far about this device and try to find out whether it will be as good as, if not better, than rival foldable smartphones already on the market.\n\nThe iPhone Flip could end up being Apple's first-ever smartphone with folding screen technology. It may not even be called the iPhone Flip. Others have suggested it could be the iPhone Fold.\n\nIt's still very early days yet, so most of the information is just guesswork and speculation.\n\nThere have been a few leaks about certain specs, and some have said that it will most likely be released in late 2024, meaning there's still a long way to go. Anything can happen with regard to design and specifications between now and then. Others have said it won't arrive until 2025.\n\nSome of the only leaked details include that it will have up to an 8-inch LG OLED screen (or possibly 7.5 inches), meaning it will be slightly larger than its rival Galaxy Z Fold 4 screen that measures 7.60 inches. If rumours are to be true, it could end up measuring up to a whopping 9 inches.\n\nIt's likely to come with new & improved smartphone screen folding technology, more substantial computing power, and a better camera than its rivals, and will incorporate several innovative new built-in features to rival other foldable smartphones.\n\nFoldable phones are great for playing graphically demanding AAA video games and watching 4K Ultra HD movies and television shows. Many online casino players also say that they are fantastic for playing cutting-edge live dealer casino games from award-winning iGaming software providers like Evolution Gaming.\n\nIf you're keen to stay up to date with the latest industry casino news UK stories, don't forget to check out the official 32Red blog.\n\nThere are just a handful of foldable smartphones on the market today, and the reviews seem positive for most devices. However, before purchasing the first foldable smartphone you find on the first website you visit, remember to carry out your own research.\n\nOther trusted folding smartphones you may also want to consider getting are the Royole Foldable Phone (FlexPai), the Motorola Razr 2022, the Motorola Razr 2020, and the Microsoft Surface Duo 2.\n\nFoldable phones are bigger than your average smartphone and smaller than your average tablet. When the screen is fully unfolded, foldable phones are great for more than just playing games and watching your favourite content.\n\nYou can also multi-task on foldable smartphones with several different apps open and running at the same time. You can get more apps in view at the same time, something that you can't do on most regular smartphones.\n\nThe only two real downsides of foldable smartphones are the battery life and the prices. Most of these devices are still way out of the average consumer's price range. However, today's foldable smartphone manufacturers continue to make improvements with regard to batteries, and the prices will eventually come down.\n\nIt's hard to say whether Apple's first foldable smartphone will be an improvement on the current state-of-the-art foldable phones. However, knowing Apple, they will no doubt release a ground-breaking foldable smartphone to rival all others currently on the market. We will just have to wait and see.",

Children under eight would only be allowed eight minutes of smartphone usage.\n\nThe proposed rules also call for providers of smart devices to introduce \"minor mode\" programs that block internet access on mobile devices from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Time limits would also be set for smartphone usage during the day.\n\nWhile the move is aimed at protecting children's health and well-being, it has had an impact on Chinese tech firms. Shares in these companies fell after the announcement of the draft guidelines.\n\nThe Chinese government has been taking steps to regulate the technology industry, and has previously imposed a curfew for video game players under 18. The latest proposed rules indicate a renewed focus on protecting the younger generation from the potential harmful effects of excessive smartphone usage.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China is seeking public feedback on the guidelines until September 2, after which the final rules will be implemented.",

        "body": "As the blazing summer sun beats down on Kuwait, shoppers stroll down a promenade lined with palm trees and European-style boutiques, all without breaking a sweat.\n\nIn one of the world's hottest desert countries, it's all made possible by architecture and technology: the entire street is located inside the heavily air-conditioned Kuwait City shopping mall.\n\nOutside, where temperatures now often soar around 50 degrees Celsius, barely anyone is moving around on foot, leaving the historic market largely deserted.\n\n\"Only a few people stay in Kuwait at this time of year,\" said date merchant Abdullah Ashkanani, 53, as large fans sprayed cooling mist onto the few customers braving the blistering heat.\n\nAshkanani, who hails from Iran, said he keeps his shop open largely \"for appearances\" during the hottest months when most of Kuwait's four million residents flee abroad.\n\nFor those who stay behind in the tiny oil-rich country, life is made bearable by the ever-present Arctic blast of air-con systems.\n\n\"We can put up with it because the house, the car, everything is air-conditioned,\" said pensioner Abou Mohammad, dressed in a white robe and keffiyeh and sitting in a comfortably cooled cafe.\n\nThe irony is not lost on him that such energy-guzzling systems produce the carbon emissions that are heating up the planet - especially the sweltering Gulf region, a climate hotspot.\n\nSuch excessive energy consumption, said Mohammad, has \"brought this heat to Kuwait\".\n\nHeating up\n\nKuwait is home to 7% of the world's crude reserves - energy wealth that has long afforded many of its people a luxury lifestyle.\n\nAn extremely water-scarce country, it also relies heavily on fossil fuels to power seawater desalination plants.\n\nLike Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Kuwait is one of the world's leading emitters per capita of CO2, a key driver of global warming.\n\nKuwait has always been hot, its dry summers fanned by the northwesterly shamal wind that also blows over Iraq and Saudi Arabia.\n\nTemperatures in Mitribah, a remote area in northwest Kuwait, often soar past 50 degrees Celsius, making it one of the hottest places on Earth after Death Valley in eastern California.\n\nBut in recent years, climate change has made summer peaks hotter and longer, said meteorologist Essa Ramadan, as periods of extreme heat have gone \"from two weeks to about a month\".\n\nThe number of days per year that see temperatures rise above 50C have more than tripled since the turn of the century, noted the meteorologist.\n\nAs the world records ever more heat records, \"what is happening to us will happen elsewhere\", he warned.\n\nKuwait - where glass towers soar into the sky and cars choke the highways - has only recently invested in public transport and green energy to help counter climate change.\n\nIts environment protection authority, which falls under the oil ministry, recognises \"a rise in temperatures in recent years\", its director Samira Al-Kandari said.\n\nTo help change course, Kuwait has started building its first commercial solar power park, the Shagaya project.\n\nWith the first phase complete, and other projects planned, Kandari said Kuwait's goal is that \"renewable energy constitutes 15% of our energy production by 2035\".\n\n\"We will increase this percentage in the future,\" she said.\n\nWATCH | Beijing rains the heaviest since records began 140 years ago\n\nOutside of the state institutions, some Kuwaiti citizens have launched grassroot initiatives, including tree-planting to help cool sun-baked urban environments.\n\nEssa Al-Essa, a 46-year-old dentist, started planting trees as a \"hobby\" in a vacant, sandy lot near his home on the outskirts of the capital, he told AFP.\n\nIn 2020, at the height of the Covid pandemic, he developed it into the Kuwait Forest project, starting a green space that also helps scrub the air and captures carbon.\n\n\"Trees are particularly useful in polluted places such as industrial and residential areas,\" said Essa.\n\nBut he also hopes the natural shade and cooling they provide will help break the dominance of energy-intensive air-conditioning.\n\n\"The more we cool our houses,\" Essa said, \"the more we warm our surroundings.\"",

This year, it began on 17 July and is expected to last until 24.\n\nWith up to 100 shooting stars expected per hour, real stargazing lovers are treated to bright meteors.\n\nOh, and there's even the chance of seeing fireballs - these are super bright meteors, basically.\n\nIt's caused by our planet slamming into the debris left behind by comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle in July and August every year.\n\nPlus, the Perseid meteor shower will bring the rather impressive meteors with long trains.There should be some pretty dramatic sights in the sky during the night of 12 August into the early morning of the 13 August.\n\nThe event gets its name as the meteors seem to originate from the constellation of Perseus.\n\nYou can watch out for the shower wherever you are, but obviously there are spots that will likely be better than others.\n\nReducing the amount of light pollution in your field of view will improve your chances of seeing clearer meteors, so head to a nearby park or even out to the countryside if you can.\n\nThe Royal Museums Greenwich also say you should probably avoid looking at your phone and give your eyes at least 15 minutes to adjust - this will mean you have a better chance of catching even the more fainter meteors.\n\nIt goes without saying you'll want to be somewhere where you can see more of the sky - you don't want big buildings and trees blocking your view.\n\nAnd apparently, you don't even need special equipment because all this will do is restrict how much you can actually see.\n\nIt's simply better to watch a Perseid meteor shower with the naked eye.\n\nYou should be able to see some action as soon as the sun sets, so will probably be worth having a look up into the sky in the early evening.\n\nThe experts also advise that it's best to try and spot meteors when the moon is below the horizon or in its crescent phase, otherwise it acts as natural light pollution.\n\nGenerally the best time to see the Perseid meteor shower is between midnight and 5:30am, so you might want to grab a blanket or two when you head into the dark with a deck chair.\n\nObviously, UK weather right now is totally unpredictable - even more than usual it seems as one minute your boiling in the sun and next drenched by the rain.\n\nBut if it does end up cloudy on this peak night, the showers set to carry on until 24 august.",

        "body": "While the CEO's old handle is locked, someone set up an account with a very similar username\n\nSomeone took the opportunity to troll X's CEO after she changed her username to reflect the platform's branding.\n\nLinda Yaccarino previously used the username @lindayacc, before changing it to @lindayaX. According to Gizmodo, the old username is no longer in operation. But someone took the opportunity to create a very similar handle.\n\n@lindayaccs is one letter off from the original. The account features Yaccarino's image, and as Gizmodo notes, looks much like her old profile.\n\nBut there are a couple of acceptions. The profile features humorous tweets (or is it xeets?) and appears to link to an adult entertainment website.\n\nThe account also features the term \"parody\" in several places, which makes the existence of the account permissible under the company's rules. Such accounts are allowed as long as users differentiate them with the terms \"parody,\" \"fake,\" \"fan,\" or \"commentary\" in the username and bio.\n\nBut as Elon Musk has shown in the past, such rules only apply if he wants them to. This was seen through his handling of the former Twitter account tracking his jet. The account used publicly available information, and Musk said he wouldn't ban the account because of his \"commitment to free speech.\" That didn't last long.",

        "title": "Component of food additive soy lecithin is linked to digestive issues, studies show",
        "body": "Many Americans consume up to five times the daily need of linoleic acid, a component found it soy lecithin that can contribute to digestive issues.\n\nSoy lecithin, which comes from soybean oil, makes foods creamier. It's also an inexpensive ingredient in cooking oils, where UC Riverside researchers say that's where we get most of it.\n\n\"It's been a huge increase and that increase happened primarily over the 1960s and the 1970s,\" said toxicologist Frances Sladek.\n\nSladek says that tofu, soy milk and other soy proteins are fine. The concern is the linoleic acid found in soybean oil. Our bodies need 1-2% daily, but many Americans take in 8-10%.\n\n\"And that's what the problem is,\" remarked Sladek. \"It's really an issue of the amount of soybean oil and hence the amount of linoleic acid that we are taking in.\"\n\nIn animal studies, microbiology researcher Sonia Deol found excessive linoleic acid to be associated with irritable bowel diseases and a leaky gut.\n\n\"In our study, what we have found is that linoleic acid is able to increase the susceptibility to colitis, which is basically an inflamed colon,\" said Deol. \"Linoleic acid decreases the expression of a protein that is very important in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier.\"\n\nResearchers also found that linoleic acid decreases the good bacteria in the gut microbiome and increases the bad. Though these studies were done in animals, researchers see a strong human connection.\n\n\"This bad bacteria that we found when we fed the mice the soybean oil diet, that was the same type of bacteria that came from human IBD patients,\" said Sladek.\n\nSladek recommends a few tips to help avoid too much linoleic acid intake. First, read the packaging.\n\n\"You want to read those labels and avoid the ones that have soybean oil. Again, it's not gonna have a lot but it's all gonna add up,\" said Sladek.\n\nAdditionally, avoiding processed and fried foods can help reduce linoleic acid.\n\nAt home, olive, avocado or coconut oil serve as healthier alternatives to soybean oil.\n\nIt is also important to remember that farm-fed animals and fish are usually given soy byproducts.\n\nOverall, Sladek says that a greater attention to what we consume can greatly benefit us: \"We need an additional awareness of just what we're eating.\"",

        "title": "Microsoft makes concession for Office in AWS virtual desktop",
        "body": "Interest from antitrust regulators spurred action? Still a pricey option, says analyst, and change doesn't help Google or Alibaba customers\n\nMicrosoft is making a minor concession that allows customers with specific licenses to run Office wares in an AWS cloud - a week after Europe's competition regulators decided to officially probe its biz policies and practices.\n\nThe licensing tweak, first noticed by analyst Directions on Microsoft (DoM), in part reverses a licensing change made in 2019 that meant customers with perpetual licenses would need to buy fresh licenses to run those applications on AWS, Google Cloud or Alibaba infrastructure.\n\nThis, according to Google, made it five times more expensive to use Microsoft software on any other major cloud computing provider than Azure. As customers reached the end of their contracts, the new policy kicked in and many then realized how financially painful this could be.\n\nAmid mounting complaints in Europe about Microsoft's alleged anti-competitive behavior, the company rolled out some changes to licenses in October, but these did not address the cost issue of bring-your-licenses to any of the three major cloud rivals. AWS wasn't best pleased.\n\nFast-forward, and new licensing terms were outlined by Microsoft yesterday which only help AWS clouds customers.\n\nMicrosoft said in a licensing update that: \"Beginning August 1, 2023, users with specific licenses may run Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise/business, Microsoft Project, and Microsoft Visio on Amazon WorkSpaces. The licenses that will be eligible under this revised policy include Microsoft 365 E3/E5/A3/A5 and Microsoft 365 Business Premium. If you currently have any of these licenses, starting from August 1, you will be able to utilize these Microsoft applications on Amazon WorkSpaces virtual desktop infrastructure.\"\n\nAWS said at the same time that its AWS \"End User Computing customers\" would be able to \"use Microsoft 365 licenses through a 'bring your own license' (BYOL) model on our Amazon WorkSpaces services.\"\n\nIt added: \"Included apps vary by Microsoft 365 license plan. Microsoft allows E3, E5, A3, A5, and Business Premium licenses to run on WorkSpaces services. Customers can also bring licenses for Microsoft Project and Microsoft Visio to WorkSpaces services under the new licensing terms.\"\n\nWes Miller, analyst at DoM, said the concession gives users a \"very premium way to run 'Office' on WorkSpaces, partially addressing some issues with Microsoft on AWS,\" but said it remains a costly alternative to Azure.\n\n\"You'll need a Microsoft 365 E3 or E5 subscription for every user accessing Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise on Workspaces.\"\n\n\"Not Microsoft 365 licensed separately. Not Office 365 E3. You need Microsoft 365 E3, even if you don't need EMS (Enterprise Mobility and Security). And you still need VDA (Virtual Desktop Access) for your WorkSpaces users.\"\n\nGot that? Effectively it means Microsoft is \"still offering far better terms with Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) or Windows 365 than they do for AWS, Google or Alibaba,\" Miller concluded.\n\nAWS confirmed the move itself, saying: \"Your end users can now benefit from Microsoft 365 apps on WorkSpaces services along with their other devices.\"\n\nEligible applications - for the absence of doubt - include Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook OneDrive and more. The concession is applicable to all AWS Regions where WorkSpaces is available.\n\n\"Customers using Microsoft 365 Apps on WorkSpaces services can also bring licenses to install and use additional Microsoft applications including Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, and Microsoft Power Automate,\" said AWS.\n\nWe have asked Google Cloud and Alibaba to comment. And we have asked Microsoft why it chose to offer concessions for AWS, the largest public cloud biz in the market by some measure, if it plans to extend the concession and why it chose to act now.\n\nCynics might suggest it is connected to the growing interest from regulatory authorities in the complaints being made in the EU and across the pond about the alleged anticompetitive behavior from Microsoft.\n\nThere are two strands: the first centers on the bundling of Microsoft's Teams with its dominant Office productivity suite, which is the one the European Commission decided to formally probe from last week.\n\nThe other pertains to the licensing policies mentioned above. Microsoft has already settled a joint complaint with OVHcloud, Aruba S.p.a and DCC in March, but the content of this will not be made public. Separately, the Cloud Infrastructure Service Providers of Europe (CISPE) trade body fired off its own complaint to the EU in November, also about Redmond's software and cloud policies. Microsoft tried to settle this, but the group - backed by AWS - refused.\n\nToday, Francisco Mingorance, secretary general at CISPE, told us the news that Microsoft 365 customers can bring licenses to AWS virtual desktop at no extra cost was a \"positive step\" but \"does not for far enough.\"\n\n\"Software licensing restrictions need to be lifted for all cloud customers,\" he added.\n\nHe echoed Google in saying: \"This news demonstrates that there is no technical reason why Microsoft can't embrace fair software licensing quickly, and easily remove unfair licensing terms.\n\nHe went on to claim: \"Despite this concession, Microsoft continues to harm European cloud customers by stalling any substantive negotiations with CISPE, the voice of smaller European providers. Regulatory action must be taken.\" \u00ae",

        "body": "Google is druk bezig met AI te integreren in al zijn producten. Onlangs bracht de zoekmachinegigant Bard uit op de Europese markt. De technologie die daarachter zit, zou op een bepaald punt ook Google Assistant moeten aandrijven. Nu blijkt dat ook YouTube niet gespaard blijft van AI-integraties.\n\nMeerbepaald wil Google een generatief AI-systeem in YouTube integreren. Daarmee wil het gebruikers samenvattingen geven van video's. Dit moet gebruikers helpen om video's te kiezen waarin ze ge\u00efnteresseerd zijn en ze op die manier heel wat tijd besparen.\n\nHet is niet de bedoeling dat de AI-samenvattingen de huidige beschrijvingen, die door de uploaders bij de video's geplaatst worden, gaat vervangen. In plaats daarvan zullen de samenvattingen boven of onder die beschrijving komen. De functie doet enigszins denken aan Bing, die sinds kort ook samenvattingen kan schrijven van webpagina's.\n\nBen je geabonneerd op YouTube Premium? Dan kan het dus zijn dat je plots zo'n samenvatting ziet staan. De functie zal namelijk exclusief beschikbaar zijn voor YouTube Premium-leden. Het abonnement vormt echter geen garantie dat je de samenvattingen te zien krijgt. Een woordvoerder van Google haalt bij The Verge aan dat er wel vaker experimenten uitgevoerd worden waarbij een deel van de gebruikers een functie ziet, maar een ander deel niet. Dat is bijvoorbeeld ook het geval voor de laatste update van Google Discover.\n\nVolgens Google is de AI-integratie voor YouTube een goede zaak, simpelweg omdat er zo veel content op het platform te vinden is. Elke video door mensen laten samenvatten is, volgens de zoekmachinegigant, onbegonnen werk. Bovendien zou zo'n AI-systeem dat video's samenvat ook kunnen helpen om betere video's voor te stellen.\n\nDe vraag is maar hoe accuraat Google's AI al die video's kan samenvatten. De functie is momenteel enkel toegankelijk voor een handvol video's in het Engels, wat het erg moeilijk maakt om vast te stellen hoe precies de samenvattingen later zullen zijn.",

        "title": "Multinationals make Ireland a 'very attractive' cyberattack target",
        "body": "Blackberry's Dmitry Bestuzhev spoke to SiliconRepublic.com about the geopolitical issues that impact Irish cybersecurity and 'initial access brokers', which sell stolen data on organisations to aid other cyberattacks.\n\nWhile Ireland is a small nation in the world-stage, that doesn't make it safe from the looming threat of cyberattacks.\n\nReports from earlier this year suggest many Irish businesses have fallen victim to cyberattacks, while larger entities such as Dublin Airport and Munster Technological University have been targeted by attackers in recent months.\n\nDmitry Bestuzhev is the senior director of Blackberry's cyber threat intelligence division, which focuses on identifying cyberattacks.\n\nSpeaking to SiliconRepublic.com, Bestuzhev said that this division saw \"at least 4,000\" malicious documents targeting Irish organisations in roughly two and a half months. While many of these attacks were prevented, Bestuzhev said each successful attack can prove damaging for organisations and pave the way for future, more intrusive attacks.\n\nInitial access attacks\n\nBestuzhev said there's an industry within the cybercriminal space of \"initial access brokers\", who focus on gaining access to organisations and stealing relevant information without being detected.\n\nThis stolen data can include passwords, cookies, screenshots of relevant information and specific details about employees, such as their IP addresses. Bestuzhev said these brokers then bundle this information into a package and sell it on the dark web or on apps like Telegram.\n\n\"So when an attacker buys those credentials, they can emulate that environment to make it [look] exactly the same,\" Bestuzhev said.\n\nThese attacks act as scouting ventures, which are then utilised by other attackers to get deeper into the networks of organisations and conduct more damaging attacks, such as data breaches and ransomware. This information also makes it easier for attackers to remain undetected when breaching networks.\n\nOne example of attackers having long-term access was shown in 2021 when Ireland's Health Service Executive (HSE) was hit with a massive ransomware attack. An investigation later that year suggested the threat actors had access to HSE systems for two months before they launched the attack.\n\nBestuzhev said his team found initial access brokers selling data related to multiple organisations in Ireland, including some government agencies like the Department of Foreign Affairs. He also said Blackberry informed relevant authorities about this issue.\n\nEntering corporate networks\n\nIreland is known for the high number of multinational companies that set up hubs here. Our location between Europe and the US - combined with an educated workforce - has led to many tech giants placing their European headquarters here.\n\nThis connection to other, larger countries adds to the risk of cyberattackers targeting Ireland, according to Bestuzhev. Certain cyberattackers could see Irish offices as an \"entry point\" to gain access to a company's network, which can then be used to conduct \"lateral movement\" into other offices in the US or other countries.\n\nBestuzhev said geopolitical factors can also be a concern in terms of cyberattacks targeting Ireland. Blackberry recently claimed a threat actor dubbed RomCom targeted a US-based healthcare company, which provided humanitarian aid to refugees fleeing from the conflict in Ukraine.\n\n\"For Ireland it's hard, because again, helping refugees, hosting companies, like the huge businesses, it's not because Ireland would be an enemy or someone,\" Bestuzhev said. \"It's just a very attractive target, because of all those situations.\"\n\nMost targeted sectors\n\nThe Irish data Bestuzhev discussed was linked to a larger Threat Intelligence Report conducted by Blackberry, which looked at the trends in the cybersecurity sector and the biggest threats it faces.\n\nIn terms of industries, this report claimed that organisations in healthcare and financial services were the most targeted.\n\n\"In healthcare, the combination of valuable data and critical services presents a lucrative target for cybercriminals, resulting in ransomware gangs directly targeting healthcare organisations and in the proliferation of information stealing malware,\" the report said.\n\nUnfortunately, these factors have made healthcare a constant target for cyberattacks in recent years. In May, a report by Cork cybersecurity company Smarttech247 claimed Irish hospitals and healthcare providers saw a 60pc spike in attempted cyberattacks over an eight week period.\n\nLast year, a French hospital was forced to send patients to other institutions after being hit with a ransomware attack, as various systems were rendered inaccessible.\n\nThe previous month, the UK's National Health Service suffered disruptions from a cyberattack, which targeted systems that facilitate patient referrals, ambulance bookings, out-of-hours appointments and emergency prescriptions.\n\n10 things you need to know direct to your inbox every weekday.

        "title": "The In-Window Air Conditioner Everyone Is Going to Ask You About",
        "body": "July's sleek and powerful unit beats the heat -- all while looking good.\n\nWelcome to The Esquire Endorsement. Heavily researched. Thoroughly vetted. These picks are the best way to spend your hard-earned cash.\n\nWindow air conditioners are nobody's favorite way to cool their home. They're ugly, they're loud, they're energy-inefficient, and if you're anything like me, you've spent an inordinate amount of time wondering, \"Is this going to tumble out of my window and kill someone?\"\n\nBut it doesn't have to be this way. Enter July, a direct-to-consumer brand promising to disrupt the staid air conditioner aisle at Home Depot. Earlier this summer, in search of an alternative to the clunky Frigidaire cooling my bedroom with all the elegance of a jet engine, I swapped in July's medium-sized window unit. Sleek, chic, and powerful as hell, it arrived right on time for Earth's hottest summer on record -- and it's revolutionized how I cool my apartment. If you use window air conditioning to cool your home, there's still time to make a savvy and stylish upgrade before the summer ends.\n\nIf you don't have central air conditioning, you know the agonies of window cooling: window units seemingly take ages to cool down a room, and even once the temperature has plunged, the coverage is still drafty at best.\n\nBut that's not the case with July. At its lowest fan speed, the July air conditioner cools my fairly spacious bedroom in ten minutes flat -- in fact, sometimes I have to dial up the temperature after ten minutes to avoid getting goosebumps. In the two months I've owned it, I've only raised the fan speed from low to medium once -- that's how powerful it is. With that much horsepower, there are no stubborn pockets of heat lingering in my space.With all that power, the air conditioner is far from whisper-quiet, but its brand of white noise is no louder than any other window air conditioner I've owned.\n\nSHOP $349, july.ac\n\nPicture this: it's a sweltering summer night, you're stumbling home late from a fun night out, and all you want is to do is fall into bed. Then, as you walk through the front door, you remember, \"Oh, shit. I'm going to have to turn the air conditioner on and wait for the bedroom to cool down.\"\n\nThat used to be me -- until I met July. Because the July unit is WiFi-controlled, I'm able to turn it on and adjust the settings from afar using the July app. Nowadays, I rev up my air conditioner when I'm fifteen minutes away and come home to a blissfully cool bedroom, all ready for me to bunker down for the night. It's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Home, so wherever you fall on the smart home spectrum, your phone is basically a long-distance remote.\n\nNo, seriously. Heralded by The Wall Street Journal as \"the sexy air conditioner,\" the July unit has a polished, design-forward look (words that have surely never been used to describe a window air conditioner before). Made of matte white plastic, it ventilates through the top of the unit rather than out the front, meaning that in the place of grimy grates and grills, you're left looking at a customizable magnetic display plate. Sold in various shades of matte plastic, along with textures like linen, wood, and preserved moss (!), you can mix and match these display plates to suit your space. If you, like me, refuse to go to all the trouble of removing your air conditioner during the colder months, you won't be unhappy about staring at the streamlined unit while sipping hot chocolate in December.\n\nSHOP $349, july.ac\n\nAir conditioning may cool down our homes, but it's heating up our planet. As journalist Eric Dean Wilson explains in After Cooling: On Freon, Global Warming, and the Terrible Cost of Comfort, modern refrigerants (the liquids that make our air conditioners work) are potent greenhouse gases with extremely high global warming potential. July air conditioners use R32, a state-of-the-art refrigerant endorsed by Daikin, the world's largest air conditioner manufacturer, as \"the most balanced refrigerant.\" R32 has two-thirds less GWP (global warming potential) than other common refrigerants, meaning that it traps two-thirds less heat in our ever-warming atmosphere.\n\nClearly this means good things for the environment -- but what does it mean for you? July claims that its air conditioners consume 10 percent less energy than their competitors. I'm no data scientist, but ever since installing the unit, I've clocked a mild (but noticeable!) reduction in my summertime energy bills.\n\nIn the age of climate emergency, we're locked in a dangerous dance with air conditioning: we need it to survive our warming planet, but our dependence on it is ratcheting up global temperatures. Solving that problem will require government action, energy reform, and massive political willpower. But for now, swapping out the appliances in your home for energy-efficient models (that look and feel terrific!) is a stellar way to start doing your part.",
